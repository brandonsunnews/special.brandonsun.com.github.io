Here are some makeup tips to ensure you look your best.  BE YOURSELF    Your wedding isn’t the right time to try out a new look. Instead, strive for a slightly enhanced version of the make- up you normally wear. For some, this may be dark eyeliner and a bold lip and for others, it may be a natural but radi- ant look.  DO A TEST RUN    Try out your wedding-day makeup in advance. If you’re doing it yourself, run through applying it a few times. If you’re hiring a makeup artist, schedule an appointment a few weeks before the big day. Doing a test run will ensure you’re happy with the results.  USE THE RIGHT PRODUCTS    Even if you’re not usually the emotional type, plan for tears on your wedding day. Opt for waterproof mascara, high quality liquid foundation and lipstick that won’t smudge.    Don’t forget to pack a kit that includes concealer, blot- ting papers and your lipstick for touch ups throughout the day.  » Wire Services                                               A makeup artist prepares a bride before her wedding.
