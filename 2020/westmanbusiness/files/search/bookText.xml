        FYidoctors helping Brandonites look to a brighter future




          In  these unprecedented times,  the future
        may seem blurry or unfocused. If this is the case
        a trip to see the optometrists at FYidoctors may
        be overdue.
          In 1980, under the name ‘Dr’s Bourassa and
        Williamson’, Dr. Don Williamson and his wife
        Dr. Barbara Bourassa opened their first Bran-
        don office. After two more name changes: West-
        man Optometric in 1985 and Total Eye Care in
        1996, the practice became FYidoctors in 2008
        assuming the name of its parent company and
        continued to grow from there.
          Establishing two central locations at the
        Brandon Shoppers Mall and the Town Centre
        the  practice  has  steadfastly  served  the  mem-
        bers of the Brandon community. Dr. Williamson
        remarked on the beneficial partnership that the
        business has had with the downtown commu-
        nity over the years as it has continued to grow
        and expand.
          “The  Town Centre folks have always been
        good to us … it’s a really nice community down-
        town and we’re glad to be a part of it,” he said.
          The FYidoctors network is one of the most ex-
        pansive eye care providers across Canada. With
        over 200 doctors across Canada, they can pro-
        vide care for the various conditions and vision
        needs of their patients. The team of optome-
        trists are a knowledgeable group of profession-
        als who are constantly seeking out new meth-
        ods of practicing.

        The grass is greener at Garden Variety Brandon





          With several options to choose from,
        picking the right cannabis retailer might
        seem like a tough task.
          However, the staff at Brandon’s Garden
        Variety location at 1350 18th St. lead the
        way with friendly, knowledgeable service
        that benefits both newcomers and expe-
        rienced customers alike.
          Visitors quickly get the impression that
        their grass is indeed greener.
          Garden  Variety is a partnership be-
        tween Fisher River Cree Nation, Chip-
        pewas of the Thames First Nation, Mera
        Cannabis Corp. and MediPharm Labs.
        Operational support is provided by part-
        ner, Native Roots Cannabis Co. located in
        Colorado.
          The Brandon location, which opened
        on Dec. 23, 2019, is one of three the com-
        pany runs — all in friendly Manitoba.

        Dohie  said  the  goal  is  to  expand  across
        Canada in the months and years ahead.
          Dohie said that Manitoba has real-
        ly embraced the brand and she believes
        that’s in large part due to the inviting
        design of their stores. Part of that invit-
        ing nature comes from the front-to-back
        friendly design. Unlike other cannabis
        retailers, Garden Variety’s windows aren’t
        papered over or blocked.

        est numbers released by the City of
        Brandon.
          There have been notable changes
        in both the number of construction
        projects and  the total value of the
        projects being built, said Murray
        Fischer, the City’s building safety
        manager.
          A total of 377 construction permits
        had been issued during all of 2020 up
        to Sept. 30, totalling a reported value
        of approximately $51.46 million.
          This breaks down into 259 resi-
        dential building  permits  and  118
        non-residential building permits.
        Non-residential building projects
        include commercial, industrial and
        educational/institutional projects.
          Over the same period of time in
        2019, the City of Brandon issued
        458 construction permits, for a to-
        tal value of approximately $121.26
        million. This breaks down into 264
        residential building permits and 194
        non-residential building permits.

          Additionally, women are less likely than men to apply and be considered for man-  (cawee.net)

        The people behind Canada’s small business resurgence



          After nearly 20 years of stagnation, entrepreneurial activi-
        ty in Canada is making a comeback. In fact, more Canadians
        launched small businesses in 2018 than any other year in the
        previous decade. To find out more about the people leading
        this resurgence, the Business Development Bank of Canada
        (BDC) conducted two national surveys on entrepreneurship
        in 2018. Here’s what they found.
          Millennials and Gen Zers accounted for roughly one-third
        of new entrepreneurs. Over the previous four years, the
        number of Canadians under 35 years old starting a business
        jumped by 80 per cent.
          Four times more women are entrepreneurs now than they
        were 40 years ago, accounting for about 28 per cent of all Ca-
        nadian small business owners. The growth in female entre-
        preneurship was about three times faster than that of male
        entrepreneurship.
          One in four small business owners is a recent immigrant.
        What’s more, the rate of entrepreneurs entering the market
        is twice as high among newcomers than among the Canadi-
        an-born population.
          A growing number of baby boomers are starting small busi-
        nesses late in their careers. In fact, the number of new Cana-
        dian entrepreneurs over the age of 55 tripled between 2000
        and 2018.
          Nearly 41 per cent of entrepreneurs have a post-secondary
        degree, despite university graduates making up only 26 per
        cent of the Canadian workforce.  The university graduation
        rate is even higher among women and immigrants.
          In addition to their major contribution to the recent growth
        in entrepreneurial activity, these changes to the demograph-
        ics of small business owners in Canada have created a more
        diverse market.                                       Seamstress measures fabric in textile workshop.

        Four tips for rebuilding your business post-pandemic




          Nearly all small businesses have suffered in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, but
        many are capable of recovery. To mark BDC Small Business Week, which runs from
        October 18 to 24, here are four tips to help businesses re-emerge following the pan-
        demic.
        1. DETERMINE THE DAMAGE
          In order to recover, you’ll first need to assess the impact that COVID-19 has had
        on your business. Update your financial statements and compare them to last year’s
        figures. Remember to factor in other types of loss such as employee layoffs and a
        reduced marketing budget.

        2. REVISIT YOUR BUSINESS PLAN
          You need to figure out how your business model fits in with the new normal. For
        many small companies, this is a good time to expand your digital store as more peo-
        ple are shopping online. You should also adapt your business growth goals to better
        reflect the current reality.
        3. LOOK INTO AVAILABLE FUNDING
          Now more than ever, you need to spend money to make money. As you create a
        recovery budget, find out whether your business qualifies for government funding
        that will help you bounce back. Financial institutions may also offer more lenient
        loans to help struggling entrepreneurs.

        4. CREATE A REALISTIC TIMELINE
          It’s important to keep in mind that your business won’t recover overnight, and you
        won’t be able to implement all your rebuilding strategies at once. Establish your pri-
        orities and track your progress to ensure you’re investing in the right areas.

        For remote IT support choose myITsource





          If you’re running a business that only
        reacts to computer problems after they
        happen,  you  need  to  look  into  myIT-
        source.
          Founded in 1998, the Brandon-based
        company can help you with your IT
        problems, but they also aim to solve
        problems before they happen with their
        world-class service.
          By signing up for their full managed
        services, you can make sure that your
        company’s technology needs are taken
        care of by Western Manitoba’s largest IT
        support company.
          They can handle any IT needs for small
        and medium-sized businesses anywhere
        in Western Manitoba. They cover an area
        as far north as Dauphin and as south as
        the U.S. border.  They even have some
        customers in eastern Saskatchewan.
          Founder and owner Frank Arndt likens
        myITsource’s full managed services to an
        all-inclusive resort.
          “Once you pay your fee, that includes
        your Office 365 subscription ... that also
        includes an antivirus program, spam
        protection and that includes our service
        desk remotely monitoring your entire IT
        environment,” Arndt said.
          “We see what’s  going  on before  you
        even know what’s wrong with your com-
        puter or your network,” he added. “In a
        lot of cases, we can just remotely access
        any of your computers or your network
        and repair what’s wrong.”
          That’s right, for most problems you
        don’t have to wait for a truck to be dis-
        patched. Most problems can be solved
        remotely by the 14-person myITsource
        business team.
          “If I can solve problems remotely, then
        I can have customers all over Canada,
        North America or even Europe if I want-
        ed to,” Arndt said. Arndt added that there  Frank Arndt, founder and owner of myITsource. (Submitted)

        Kal Tire helps you get ready for any season





          Winter is on the way and Brandon’s Kal Tire location is ready to
        help you change your tires and provide top-notch mechanical ser-
        vices.
          COVID-19 has complicated operations for most businesses, but
        Kal Tire has figured out how to get your tires changed in a safe and
        sanitary way.
          Staff use steering wheel and seat covers as a protective barrier
        and high-touch surfaces receive a thorough going-over with Health
        Canada-approved sanitizing wipes before you get your car back.
          They also wear face masks when inside customer vehicles and
        while in the showroom as an extra layer of safety.
          Social and physical distancing measures are in place to keep cus-
        tomers apart while waiting for service as well.
          “It’s different than I’ve ever seen before and it took some brain-
        storming, but we got it figured out,” local store manager Brayden
        Davis said.
          Bookings, cancellations and modifications for tire change ap-

        young age. You know a lot of older people that do gardens, they’ve done them for-
        ever, but in this day and age that’s new.”
          The satisfaction of growing something and watching it bloom into something
        beautiful is one of the main attractions of gardening and why it took off so much
        over the past year.
          “I think it’s that fulfillment of having something and growing it and seeing some-
        thing at the end of it. You’re going to plant this little tiny thing and all of a sudden
        it’s going to have cucumbers on it.
          “A cabbage is this little tiny fluff you have in a pot and you plant it and it becomes
        this giant thing … I think that’s what they were looking for this year — it was a pretty
        sad and gloomy spring.”
          The expertise offered by Alternative in all departments is a huge part of what the
        company does, Griffin said. The business has experts in all areas of gardening and
        landscaping to help customers with anything they need and to answer questions,
        something many big chains can’t match.
          “We have a lot of people who come in and say ‘ok, here’s my leaf’ and they bring
        the plant in and say ‘what’s going on with it?’ And we’ll look at it and direct it and tell
        them ‘OK, this is what you need to do.”
