        For remote IT support choose myITsource





          If you’re running a business that only
        reacts to computer problems after they
        happen,  you  need  to  look  into  myIT-
        source.
          Founded in 1998, the Brandon-based
        company can help you with your IT
        problems, but they also aim to solve
        problems before they happen with their
        world-class service.
          By signing up for their full managed
        services, you can make sure that your
        company’s technology needs are taken
        care of by Western Manitoba’s largest IT
        support company.
          They can handle any IT needs for small
        and medium-sized businesses anywhere
        in Western Manitoba. They cover an area
        as far north as Dauphin and as south as
        the U.S. border.  They even have some
        customers in eastern Saskatchewan.
          Founder and owner Frank Arndt likens
        myITsource’s full managed services to an
        all-inclusive resort.
          “Once you pay your fee, that includes
        your Office 365 subscription ... that also
        includes an antivirus program, spam
        protection and that includes our service
        desk remotely monitoring your entire IT
        environment,” Arndt said.
          “We see what’s  going  on before  you
        even know what’s wrong with your com-
        puter or your network,” he added. “In a
        lot of cases, we can just remotely access
        any of your computers or your network
        and repair what’s wrong.”
          That’s right, for most problems you
        don’t have to wait for a truck to be dis-
        patched. Most problems can be solved
        remotely by the 14-person myITsource
        business team.
          “If I can solve problems remotely, then
        I can have customers all over Canada,
        North America or even Europe if I want-
        ed to,” Arndt said. Arndt added that there  Frank Arndt, founder and owner of myITsource. (Submitted)
