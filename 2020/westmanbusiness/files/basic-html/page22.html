        Sunrise Credit Union community contribution


        continues during pandemic





          Sunrise Credit Union prides itself on
        being a socially and environmentally
        conscientious company that gives backs
        to our communities.
          When the pandemic initially hit in the
        spring of 2020, Sunrise Credit Union re-
        allocated some of the resources usually
        associated with the sponsorship of ac-
        tivities and events to support organiza-
        tions on the frontline of helping people
        impacted by the pandemic.
          The Helping People of Sunrise Grant
        program supported non-profit organiza-
        tions that required assistance to provide
        emergency relief in their communities. A
        goal to help those struggling during the
        health and economic crisis, both at the
        demand and supply ends of the chain,
        was met.
          Fourteen organizations in  Western
        Manitoba received grants valued at close
        to $42,000 through the Helping People of
        Sunrise grant program.
          “Community groups are providing im-
        portant services and programs during
        this unprecedented time, and Sunrise
        Credit Union is thrilled to help support
        their activities,” said Sunrise President
        and CEO  Tim Klassen.  “Being able to
