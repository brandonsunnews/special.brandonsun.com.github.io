        The grass is greener at Garden Variety Brandon





          With several options to choose from,
        picking the right cannabis retailer might
        seem like a tough task.
          However, the staff at Brandon’s Garden
        Variety location at 1350 18th St. lead the
        way with friendly, knowledgeable service
        that benefits both newcomers and expe-
        rienced customers alike.
          Visitors quickly get the impression that
        their grass is indeed greener.
          Garden  Variety is a partnership be-
        tween Fisher River Cree Nation, Chip-
        pewas of the Thames First Nation, Mera
        Cannabis Corp. and MediPharm Labs.
        Operational support is provided by part-
        ner, Native Roots Cannabis Co. located in
        Colorado.
          The Brandon location, which opened
        on Dec. 23, 2019, is one of three the com-
        pany runs — all in friendly Manitoba.

        though — regional manager Sheilagh
        Dohie  said  the  goal  is  to  expand  across
        Canada in the months and years ahead.
          Dohie said that Manitoba has real-
        ly embraced the brand and she believes
        that’s in large part due to the inviting
        design of their stores. Part of that invit-
        ing nature comes from the front-to-back
        friendly design. Unlike other cannabis
        retailers, Garden Variety’s windows aren’t
        papered over or blocked.
