          With the changing business landscape
        in the current pandemic, U-Build has not
        been deterred from striving to support lo-
        cal businesses. The company has adapted
        by adhering to provincial regulations (so-
        cial distancing, masks when needed and
        sanitizing stations) and most of the office
        staff is working remotely to reduce the risk
        of exposure. Remote work, however, has
        not stopped regular operations but has
        increased the company’s opportunities to
        incorporate technology and social media
        into regular business practice.  Through
        consolidation with BEHLEN industries,
        U-Build has been on the technological
        fast track advancing in areas of software
        implementation, robotics and welding.
          U-Build has also embarked on a new
        campaign via their  Youtube channel
        called, Made in Canada- Supporting Ca-
        nadian Business. The company’s director,
        Rosa  Villamizar explained the purpose
        of this initiative which was put in place
        to help highlight the efforts of Canadian
        business owners affected by Covid-19.
          “This originated out of concern about
        the Canadian economy during this pan-
        demic,” she said.
