        U-Build Steel Buildings, setting a solid foundation for the future



          Every builder knows that no material
        supports  a building  like a  sturdy  steel
        frame. The same can be said about the
        support that  U-Build  Steel  Buildings
        provide for their clients in all their con-
        tracting needs.
          U-Build Steel Buildings has long been
        a member of the Westman family, and
        a proud member of the WGI (Westman
        Group Inc.).  Its  roots can  be traced  to
        Winkler Man., where, in 1968, it origi-
        nally opened its doors under the name
        Nusteel Industries.
          After re-branding in January 2017,
        U-build Steel Buildings was relocated
        to Brandon where it re-opened under a
        new name as a sales branch of BEHLEN
        Industries. Brandon has become the
        company’s  base  of  operations  housing
        not only their headquarters but their
        manufacturing  facility  and  customer
        service centre.  Winkler, their original
        home, still plays a central role in its op-
        erations where U-Build Steel Buildings
        houses its sales and detailing office.
