If this is the case         a trip to see the optometrists at FYidoctors may         be overdue.           In 1980, under the name ‘Dr’s Bourassa and         Williamson’, Dr. Don Williamson and his wife         Dr. Barbara Bourassa opened their first Bran-         don office. After two more name changes: West-         man Optometric in 1985 and Total Eye Care in         1996, the practice became FYidoctors in 2008         assuming the name of its parent company and         continued to grow from there.           Establishing two central locations at the         Brandon Shoppers Mall and the Town Centre         the  practice  has  steadfastly  served  the  mem-         bers of the Brandon community. Dr. Williamson         remarked on the beneficial partnership that the         business has had with the downtown commu-         nity over the years as it has continued to grow         and expand.           “The  Town Centre folks have always been         good to us … it’s a really nice community down-         town and we’re glad to be a part of it,” he said.           The FYidoctors network is one of the most ex-         pansive eye care providers across Canada. With         over 200 doctors across Canada, they can pro-         vide care for the various conditions and vision         needs of their patients.

Brandon Sun)           There  have  been  notable  changes  in         both the number of construction proj-         ects and the total value of the projects         being built, said Murray Fischer, the         City’s building safety manager.           A total of 377 construction permits         had been issued during all of 2020 up to         Sept. 30, totalling a reported value of ap-         proximately $51.46 million.           This breaks down into 259 residential         building permits and 118 non-residen-         tial building permits. Non-residential         building projects include commercial,         industrial and educational/institutional         projects.           Over the same period of time in 2019,         the City of Brandon issued 458 construc-         tion permits, for a total value of approx-         imately $121.26 million.

Studies have demonstrated   NETWORKING RESOURCES         that gender diversity in corporate settings increases productivity and innovation.           What’s more, women tend to bring a more humane leadership style to the ta-         ble, one based on inclusivity and the empowerment of marginalized voices.

Women continue to face numerous challenges in the business world. For one, the   • Forum for Women Entrepreneurs (fwe.ca)         wage gap persists with full-time female employees making an average of $0.87 for   • Women’s Executive Network (wxnetwork.com)         every dollar earned by men in the same position. This disparity is even wider for   • Canadian Association of Women Executives \& Entrepreneurs         women of colour, Indigenous women and recent immigrants.           Additionally, women are less likely than men to apply and be considered for man-  (cawee.net)         agement roles. Often, this is due to implicit or explicit bias among male employers.   • Women’s Enterprise Organizations of Canada (weoc.ca)         Another factor is the persistence of traditional gender roles among many couples,   Canadian Women’s Chamber of Commerce (canwcc.ca)         which leave women disproportionately responsible for childcare and household         tasks. Without a proper support system, it’s difficult for women to strike a balance         and advance in the workplace.           Yet despite these hurdles, many women are thriving in the business world, and         companies, as well as communities, are the better for it.","OCTOBER 2020 • WESTMAN BUSINESS • THE BRANDON SUN                                                                                           27                                WINTER IS RIGHT                    AROUND THE CORNER!

In fact, more Canadians launched         small businesses in 2018 than any other year in the previous de-         cade. To find out more about the people leading this resurgence,         the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) conducted         two national surveys on entrepreneurship in 2018. Here’s what         they found.           Millennials and Gen Zers accounted for roughly one-third of         new entrepreneurs. Over the previous four years, the number of         Canadians under 35 years old starting a business jumped by 80         per cent.           Four times more women are entrepreneurs now than they were         40 years ago, accounting for about 28 per cent of all Canadian         small business owners. The growth in female entrepreneurship         was about three times faster than that of male entrepreneurship.           One in four small business owners is a recent immigrant.         What’s more, the rate of entrepreneurs entering the market is         twice as high among newcomers than among the Canadian-born         population.           A growing number of baby boomers are starting small busi-         nesses late in their careers. In fact, the number of new Canadian         entrepreneurs over the age of 55 tripled between 2000 and 2018.           Nearly 41 per cent of entrepreneurs have a post-secondary de-         gree, despite university graduates making up only 26 per cent of         the Canadian workforce. The university graduation rate is even         higher among women and immigrants.           In addition to their major contribution to the recent growth         in entrepreneurial activity, these changes to the demographics         of small business owners in Canada have created a more diverse   Seamstress measures fabric in textile workshop.         market.

To mark BDC Small Business Week, which runs from         October 18 to 24, here are four tips to help businesses re-emerge following the pan-         demic.          1. DETERMINE THE DAMAGE           In order to recover, you’ll first need to assess the impact that COVID-19 has had         on your business. Update your financial statements and compare them to last year’s         figures. Remember to factor in other types of loss such as employee layoffs and a         reduced marketing budget.         2. REVISIT YOUR BUSINESS PLAN           You need to figure out how your business model fits in with the new normal. For         many small companies, this is a good time to expand your digital store as more peo-         ple are shopping online. You should also adapt your business growth goals to better         reflect the current reality.          3. LOOK INTO AVAILABLE FUNDING           Now more than ever, you need to spend money to make money. As you create a         recovery budget, find out whether your business qualifies for government funding         that will help you bounce back. Financial institutions may also offer more lenient         loans to help struggling entrepreneurs.         4. CREATE A REALISTIC TIMELINE           It’s important to keep in mind that your business won’t recover overnight, and you         won’t be able to implement all your rebuilding strategies at once. Establish your pri-         orities and track your progress to ensure you’re investing in the right areas.

Founded in 1998, the Brandon-based         company can help you with your IT         problems, but they also aim to solve         problems before they happen with their         world-class service.           By signing up for their full managed         services, you can make sure that your         company’s technology needs are taken         care of by Western Manitoba’s largest IT         support company.           They can handle any IT needs for small         and medium-sized businesses anywhere         in Western Manitoba. They cover an area         as far north as Dauphin and as south as         the U.S. border.  They even have some         customers in eastern Saskatchewan.

Most problems can be solved         remotely by the 14-person myITsource         business team.           “If I can solve problems remotely, then         I can have customers all over Canada,         North America or even Europe if I want-         ed to,” Arndt said.

Staff use steering wheel and seat covers as a protective barrier         and high-touch surfaces receive a thorough going-over with Health         Canada-approved sanitizing wipes before you get your car back.           They also wear face masks when inside customer vehicles and         while in the showroom as an extra layer of safety.           Social and physical distancing measures are in place to keep cus-         tomers apart while waiting for service as well.           “It’s different than I’ve ever seen before and it took some brain-         storming, but we got it figured out,” local store manager Brayden         Davis said.
