  When asked why he thinks he re-
peated this year, Frank jokingly said
that it must be because he’s so good
looking. “We just try and look after
people,” he said more seriously. “I
hope we’re able to keep doing that
for them.”

  “It means a lot,” Joanne said. “It
makes you work harder (because)
you want to keep it going. I don’t
know how it happens because Bran-
don is full of great people and getting
picked is a little bit indescribable. It’s
very special.”

  The couple’s business, The Paw
Resort and Wellness Centre, was
deemed to be wonderful as well,
winning gold in the “Best Pet Day
Care” category. That makes three
gold medals in a row for The Paw
in that category — every single one
since the category was introduced in
2018.

  “We have really, really good cus-
tomers,” Frank said. “They’re awe-
some.”

  Another triple threat was Gus Vasi-
larakis. The Pizza Express owner got
the gold in the “Best Business Per-
son” category — his second prize in
the segment after winning silver in
2018.

Quality together mean value… and Value is everything!
