  Dinsdale says she’s seen
many kitchens where the
top cupboards are a differ-
ent colour from the lower
cupboards and she has no
problem with that.

  She notes if there’s an
island in the kitchen, she
often likes to paint it in a
different finish from the
cabinets “instead of the up-
pers and lowers.”

  Meanwhile, wood cup-
boards are back in style,
