  While cottage prices in-

side and outside the park
average about $120,000,
she says, some have gone
for as much as $850,000 or
more.

  Woywada-Barnett notes
that if you’re buying prop-
erty inside the park, you
have to lease the land the
cottage sits on.

  “The lease of the land is
quite similar to the cost of
property taxes outside of
the park,” she says, adding
the price is dependent on
the lot.

  Unlike in the city, where
home values are based on
similar houses in the im-
mediate area, “up in our
area, there is not a cot-
tage similar to a cottage.
There’s not a lease that is
the same as the next guy.
Every property is unique
in itself.”

ers’ kids were competitive
speed swimmers.

  “It’s pretty spartan,” My-
ers said about the family
cabin.

  “It’s got a wood frame.
There’s no insulation in it,
there’s just the outside walls
and the inside and there’s
no insulation in between.
It’s got three bedrooms, all
of which are very small, sep-
arated by very narrow, very
thin walls that go up about
seven feet. It’s an open ceil-
ing, you can see the rafters
up there.”
