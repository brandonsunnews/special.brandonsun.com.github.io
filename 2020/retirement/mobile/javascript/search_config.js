For a time John spent                                           www.brandonsfors.ca time doing chaplaincy work at the Brandon Regional Health Centre and the Brandon Cor- rectional Centre. He also did parts deliveries for Princess Auto for a few years.    When that house came to be too much for them, they moved into the seniors hous- ing co-op on Brandon Avenue near the Keystone Centre that opened in May 2018.    One of the biggest draws of the co-op was that it had gar- den beds available to its resi- dents along with other ameni- ties like a machine shop and communal spaces.    “I retired from farming and said to my wife ‘I’m not a couch potato’,” John said.    During the growing season, the Penners are able to pro- duce their own vegetables, fruits and herbs. All the boxes are raised up off the ground to minimize the amount of kneeling required during the gardening process. There are plaques afﬁxed to all of the boxes to inform people which of them belong to which suites in the building.    “It’s just a delight to go out there to see everything in blossom and blooming,” John said. “It’s surprising all the produce they will bring in.”    John said that the garden- ers at the building like to give each other advice and are very co-operative. “We’re all ex- perts,” he said with a wink.","8 THE BRANDON SUN • RETIREMENT • FEBRUARY 2020  Continued from Page 7            completed before moving   “These are always fresh, put   to their current home has                                  been placed on a backing it that way,” John said about    and mounted in the common the quality of their vegetables  room at the seniors’ co-op. compared to store-bought.

Often, the habits you need to implement to live a longer, more satisfying life are easy to adopt.       1. Don’t smoke. Smoking contributes to numerous severe and potentially fatal health problems.       2. Stay active. Older adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity every week. In addition, regularly stretching helps maintain mobility and prevent falls.       3. Keep learning. Challenge your mind with prob- lem-solving activities and puzzles. This will reduce the risk of dementia and improve cognition.       4. Eat healthy. Your diet should be rich in whole grains, (Wire Services) fruits and vegetables. Avoid overeating, opt for plant proteins and eliminate saturated and trans fats.       5. Get outside. Sunshine is good for your mood and your health. Being outdoors also encourages you to be more active.       6. Sleep well. Seven to eight hours of quality sleep every night is crucial for regulating cell function and healing your body.       7.

In order to make the right choice, here are some import- ant factors to consider.  1. LOCATION    For many people, living close to their family is a top prior- ity. Plus, if you opt for a retirement home in a familiar neigh- bourhood, it can help make the transition easier. You might also want to choose a residence with nearby amenities and a safe, accessible outdoor area.  2. CARE    Consider both your current and long-term needs. Even if you’re largely independent now, you may eventually require as- sistance with personal care, laundry and housekeeping. Many facilities also have special care units to accommodate you if there are changes to your health.  3. ACTIVITIES    An extensive calendar of events and activities is a sign that the administration values your health and well-being. Access to a variety of physical, spiritual and social activities will keep you busy and help you ﬂourish in your new home.  4. DINING EXPERIENCE    Access to delicious, nutritious food can signiﬁcantly improve your quality of life. Find out if the menu offers a variety of fresh options and can accommodate dietary restrictions. Additional- ly, the dining room should be a welcoming social environment.  5. STAFF    The staff will be your main caregivers, so their attitude, qual- iﬁcations and professionalism are key. Visit the facility and ob- serve how they interact with residents. Are they warm and re- spectful or do they seem impatient and overworked?    Where you live is no small matter, so take your time in mak- ing a decision. Explore your options and don’t be afraid to ask questions. » Wire Services"];
