really good players,” Dietrich                                                                          defenceman.
said. “But I came with the
attitude that I wanted to stay
and I wanted to make it next
year. I did whatever I had to do
to make the team and was
fortunate enough to do the
right things I guess.”

  He played that season with
the Deloraine Royals, a senior
team that was later enshrined
in the Manitoba Hockey Hall
of Fame. It unknowingly
prepared him for the season
that lay ahead.

  “Winning was something
that was engrained into me,”
Dietrich said. “Baseball was
the same way. We had good
ball teams as a kid growing up.
I knew these guys (the 1978-79
Wheat Kings) were going into
a great season but nobody even
thought that we’d lose just five
games.”

  Dietrich had the good
fortune to join the team that
had the best regular season in
Canadian Hockey League
history, going an amazing 58-
5-9 for 125 points. The roster
included a who’s who of future
NHL stars, including Brad
McCrimmon, Brian Propp,
Laurie Boschman, Ray
Allison, Walt Podubny and
Steve Patrick.

  As a young defenceman he
had lots to learn, and a mentor
with plenty of experience to
teach him.

  “I was a very offensive type
of defenceman and Dunc
McCallum was our coach,”
Dietrich said. “He was an
NHL defenceman himself so
there were lots of little things
that I needed to learn. I
accepted them and put them to
use on the ice. I played the
power play the odd time and
I’m out there with Brad
McCrimmon on point with me
and Allison, Boschman and
Propp. I think I had 46 points
that year. I just had to stop the
puck behind the net and give it
to one of those guys and away
they’d go.”

  Dietrich said he started to get
a sense of how good that team
could be when they headed out
on their first extended road trip.
At the time, they played Regina
and Saskatoon 16 times per
season and had a lot of success
against them.

  They kept rolling against
non-division teams they didn’t
normally play against,
although a loss against the
Billings Bighorns also helped
them turn a corner.

  “We didn’t like it and that’s
when it kind of hit me that
these guys want to win every
game,” Dietrich said. “That’s]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2016 • THE BRANDON SUN                                                                                                                                                                              50 YEARS IN THE WESTERN HOCKEY LEAGUE • C9

The family moved to
Deloraine in 1994 when they
took over a fast-food restaurant,
and Dietrich began
volunteering to help out young
hockey players.
What would prove to be the
second chapter of Dietrich’s
story had actually started a year
earlier when Parkinson’s
symptoms began to show.
Dietrich adapted to the shakes
in his right arm by using his left
instead.
With the symptoms
worsening, Dietrich was finally
diagnosed in 1995 at age 34.
His outlook on Parkinson’s,
which he calls “his old pal,”
has changed.
“I consider myself a
Parkinson’s warrior because I
fight it every day,” Dietrich
said. “I’m just dealing with that
outlook now. I don’t know if

It all started at home for Hextall

NHL goaltender spent three seasons with the Wheat Kings in the 1980s

BY PERRY BERGSON

When Ron Hextall looks
back at his long hockey career,
the story begins in Brandon.
Now 52 and the general
manager of the Philadelphia
Flyers, Hextall enjoyed a 13-
season career as one of the best
goaltenders in the National
Hockey League.
The Winnipeg-born,
Brandon-raised netminder
began his Western Hockey
League career with the
Brandon Wheat Kings in 1981-
82 after growing up watching
the team.
“For me it was an absolute
dream come true,” Hextall
said. “Watching the big teams,
(Bill) Derlago, (Ray) Allison,
(Laurie) Boschman, (Brian)
Propp, the McCrimmon boys
(Brad and Kelly), I always
wanted to play in the NHL but
I was more focused on, at that
point, playing for the Wheat
Kings just because I knew it
came first. That was a huge
deal for me.”
Hextall came to the Wheat
Kings just after the league-
winning team of 1978-79, but
he had a ringside seat for one
of the greatest teams in
Canadian Hockey League
history.
“I sold programs at those
games,” Hextall said. “I was
dialled right in and I was at
every game.”
  His devotion to the game
started early, something he         Ron Hextall has parlayed a junior career with the Brandon Wheat Kings and a terrific NHL tenure into a front-office job with the Philadelphia Flyers as GM. (File)
