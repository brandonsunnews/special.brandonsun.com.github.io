But team captain Macoy Erkamps says the Wheat Kings haven’t forgotten the tough times. In fact he thinks the team can use them to make itself better.    “I think now that we look back on it, it’s almost better for the team,” Erkamps said. “I think battling that adversity was huge. We’re comfortable with our game right now and we’re happy to be in the spot that we are.”    He’s not the only one who thinks it. Russian defenceman Ivan Provorov thinks the struggles made the team better.    “Battling adversity along the way just made us stronger,” Provorov said. “You can tell by the way we’re playing right now.”    There were a couple of turning points in the season.    The first came when head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon, Provorov and forwards Jayce Hawryluk and John Quenneville departed for the world junior championship team tryouts.

It makes you way hungrier.”    Aside from the resulting Rockets fuel provided by the loss in the final, the Wheat Kings are confident they have a number of unique factors going for them.    Hawryluk said one factor trumps the others.    “Good chemistry,” he said. “We have a good team and a good group of guys. It’s not always the 20 best guys but it’s the 20 best guys who fit roles and get along together. You have to be a team come playoff time and everyone has to work together. I think we have a good team in our room and we’re excited for the playoffs.”    It’s a popular opinion among","#12 Stelio Mattheos    1840 18th St. North, Brandon  POSITION: CENTRE        GP 50 204-728-4243 • 1-800-224-7506   HEIGHT: 6-1             G 13                                 WEIGHT: 194             A 17         windsorplywood.com      BIRTH DATE: 1999-06-14  PTS 30                                 HOMETOWN: WINNIPEG, MB  +/- 12                                                         PIM 10","6 THE BRANDON SUN • #GOLDRUSH • MARCH 2016  BRANDON SKATERS  Player             Position Games Goals Assists Points Plus- Penalty PP                                        PP     SH          SH  Game First  Insur.
