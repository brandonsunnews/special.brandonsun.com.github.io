What’s more, suicide            is the leading cause of death            among Canadians who are 15            to 24 years old, second only to            accidents. Roughly 4,000 young            people die each year by suicide.             POTENTIAL CAUSES               Pressure to perform in            school, stigma about mental            illness, unhealthy diets, lack of            exercise and poor sleep hygiene            can all contribute to mental            health issues in teens.              Psychologists also suspect            that heavy social network use            may increase the incidence of            clinical anxiety and depression.              Finally, the lack of accessi-            ble mental health resources for            young people is partly to blame.            According to  Youth Mental            Health Canada, only one-fifth            of affected youth receive the            help they need.             WHAT PARENTS CAN DO               Young people should be            taught  that  asking  for  help            isn’t an admission of failure or            weakness.

While it offers an            assortment of benefits associ-            ated with meditation and relax-            ation, it should be approached            with caution.             WHAT IS IT?               Sophrology combines mind-            fulness meditation, breathing            exercises, body awareness and            visualization techniques. It’s in-            spired by a wide range of Asian            and European traditions.              It  became  popular  when            three Swiss skiers trained in            sophrology by Caycedo won            gold medals at the 1968 Winter            Olympics. Before long, people            were using sophrology to pre-            pare for everything from exams            to work presentations. Some            French schools even teach it to            students as a way to cope with            stress.             WHAT’S SPECIAL ABOUT IT?               Sophrology is more goal-ori-            ented than other meditation            techniques and focuses on vi-            sualizing yourself performing a            difficult task or getting through            a stressful situation successfully.              It doesn’t involve any physi-            cal work. All that’s needed is a            chair and the voice of a trained            sophrologist.             HOW IS IT PRACTISED?               This meditation technique            relies on being guided through            a series of exercises by an expert            sophrologist.
