           Veterans with PTSD, anxiety turn to beekeeping



             MANCHESTER,        N.H.
           — Gently lifting a wooden
           frame containing dozens of
           Italian honeybees, Vince Ylita-
           lo seemed transfixed as he and
           several other veterans inspected
           the buzzing insects.
             “This is really cool,” he said,
           pointing to a bee with blobs of
           orange pollen on its hind legs.
             Ylitalo, who has battled
           PTSD after serving nearly 40
           years in the military including
           two tours in Iraq, didn’t seem
           bothered by the bees swarming
           around his head or crawling all
           over the entrance to their hive.
           Instead, the 57-year-old logis-
           tics expert said the several hours
           spent working on the two hives
           each week at the Manchester
           VA Medical Center in New
           Hampshire was a respite of sorts
           from his anxiety and depression.
