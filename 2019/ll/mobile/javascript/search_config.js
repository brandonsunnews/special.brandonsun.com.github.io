Cornelsen said that              Riding Mountain has been              running a program for more              than 25 years to manage algae              and chemical levels in Clear              Lake.                “Many of our coldwater              species are right on the edge of              how much oxygen is available              to them,” Cornelsen said. “Any              change there, even small, has a              real serious impact on some of              the fish species.”                Cornelsen added that those              who own cabins and cottages              around Clear Lake can help              preserve Riding Mountain’s              biodiversity by ensuring that              their activities don’t bring any              invasive species like zebra mus-              sels into the park.                     » Continued on Page 12  A pelican profiled with some birdy buddies at Pelican Lake in the early morning hours.

For the same reason,              toxic substances should never              be disposed of at park dumps              or down the drain. Toxic sub-              stances  should always  be dis-              posed of at a toxic waste depot.              Any use of chemicals to control              the growth of water plants in              a provincial park must be ap-              proved in advance by the pro-              vincial government.                The provincial government              submitted a list of sustainability              tips for cottagers in Manitoba’s              provincial parks to  The Sun.              One piece of advice is to reduce              the transparency and reflectiv-              ity of your cottage’s windows to              prevent  birds  from flying into              them. Another piece of advice              is for cottagers to consider us-              ing rainwater for non-potable              uses like showering, washing              dishes, cleaning and flushing              toilets.                Also recommended is  to              minimize the use of commer-              cial  cleaning  products  at  your              cottage to avoid the risk of toxic              chemicals impacting local flora              and fauna. The province advis-              es cottagers  to  upgrade  their              appliances to energy efficient              models and to upgrade old-              er two-stroke marine motors              to newer four-stroke or two-              stroke  direct  injected  models              where feasible.                Another piece of advice from              both Riding Mountain and the              province is to not move fire-              wood from one location to an-              other. Insects like the emerald              ash borer can hide in firewood,              so moving the wood from place              to  place risks spreading those              insects.                Reder said that  Wilderness              Committee  hopes  to  have a              guide on how cottagers can              lighten their footprint ready              for the beginning of next year’s              cottage season. Both Sustain-              able Development Manitoba              and the federal Department              of Fisheries and Oceans have              online guides with further tips              on how cottagers can minimize              their footprint and avoid dis-              turbing nature as  they  spend              quality time out in the wild.               » cslark@brandonsun.com    Leafy spurge, pictured in Brandon, is one invasive plant Riding Mountain National Park resource conservation manager              » Twitter: @ColinSlark     Stephen Cornelson encourages cottagers to avoid planting.

Here are              some tips for making the most              of your cooler.               BEFORE LEAVING HOME                • Use a large, well-insulated              cooler with a lid and a drain              plug.                • Store foods in airtight con-              tainers or zip-closure storage              bags. If necessary, double-layer              the packaging.                • Freeze prepared foods and              drinks before  you’re  due to              leave. This will help to keep the              cooler cold during your camp-              ing trip.                • Buy blocks of ice, as they’ll              last longer than ice cubes.                • Place meats  and dairy              products next to the ice.                • Store drinks in a second              cooler.               AT THE CAMPGROUND                •  The cover of the  cooler              should be kept tightly closed              at all times; open it only when              necessary to keep the blocks of              ice intact for as long as possi-              ble.                • Keep the cooler in a shady              area, away from the sun.                • Try not to drain the wa-              ter out of the coo ler as the ice              melts; the cool water will con-              tinue to help keep the food              cold.                • Store the cooler in your ve-              hicle overnight or when you’re              away from the campsite.

Here are some tips to help you choose              the right spot.                Arrive early at the campground; it’s eas-              ier to find the right location (and set up the              tent) in daylight than it is after dark. Inspect              your campsite and choose a flat spot to pitch              your tent. If the ground isn’t level, remember              that you need to sleep with your head higher              than your feet, not the reverse. Make sure no              roots or rocks are likely to rip your tent or              worse, poke into your back all night. Choose              high ground so the area will drain well and              you won’t end up sleeping in a puddle if it              rains.                If it’s hot, put your tent in the shade to              keep it from turning into a sauna in the after-              noon.

Arriving without warn-              ing.  To get the campsite you              want and avoid being disap-              pointed, you have to reserve              your stay ahead of time, just as              you would if you were sleeping              at a hotel.                 2.  Failing to test any new              equipment.  To avoid unpleas-              ant surprises, you should do              some road-testing before you              head to the woods.

Just because the me-              teorologist says it’s going to              be sunny and hot, that doesn’t              mean it’s written in stone. Pack              clothing and plan activities that              will let you deal with any even-              tuality.                 4.  Leaving food or toilet-              ries in the tent. Store your food              and toiletries bag in the car to              prevent animals from helping              themselves to your cooler or              feasting on your tube of tooth-              paste.                 5.  Not having a repair kit.              It’s the last thing you want, but              there’s always a possibility that              your tent could start lea king.              Have you got something to re-              pair rips and tears, such as a              sewing kit or waterproof tape?                 One last tip: avoid arriving              at night.  You may find it very              frustrating to set up your tent              in the dark, especially if you’ve              never done it before. Also, test              all your camping gear before              leaving home to avoid any nasty              surprises.","THURSDAY, JUNE 20, 2019 • LAKE LIFE • THE BRANDON SUN                                                 31                                                       Wild flowers and a photographer are silhoutted against the evening sky in the dunes of Spirit Sands.
