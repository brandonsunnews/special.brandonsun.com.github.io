It emphasizes throws, pins and            submission techniques.               Brandon’s Judokan Judo Club meets twice weekly — on Mon-            days and Wednesdays — to learn and practise judo in a fun and safe            environment. Kids’ classes are at 6:30 p.m., and adult classes are at            7:30 p.m.               Registration begins Sept. 4.
