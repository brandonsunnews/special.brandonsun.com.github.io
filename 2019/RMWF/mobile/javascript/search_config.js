Lemonade and various cul-           tural dishes filled out the Key-           stone Centre during last year’s           event, and there’s always the fa-           cility’s staple: their popcorn.             Lucy Neufeld, who was in           charge of the centre’s popcorn           booth at a time during last year’s           event, said that people seem to           really respond to their blend of           salt and butter.             Although  she  declined  to           share what their secret is, she said           that there’s a “secret salt ingredi-           ent” that sets them apart from           others.             And, for those keen on special           fair treats, the less-than healthy           foods are certainly available, too.  Lemon Heaven employee Jenna Fisch squeezes fresh lemons at their stand.
