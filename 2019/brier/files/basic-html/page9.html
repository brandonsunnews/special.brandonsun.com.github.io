                 Westmanites have made their mark at Brier





             BY THOMAS FRIESEN
               The Tim Hortons Brier is back
             in Brandon for the first time in
             37 years, but Westman products
             have donned the Buffalo a
             handful of times since then.
               Most recently, it was Rob
             Fowler’s team, which has a tie
             to this year’s Team Manitoba in
             second Derek Samagalski.
             Fowler earned his fourth trip to
             the Brier in 2012, though it was
             his first as a skip. He played
             with Jeff Stoughton out of the
             Charleswood Curling Club in
             Winnipeg for the first three,
             and needed all of that experi-
             ence to get there on his own. Of                                                    Brandonite Rob Fowler, left, skipped a team that included Allan Lyburn at third to a
             course, that meant beating his                                                      bronze medal at the 2012 Brier. It was the only trip to the men’s national championship

               “It was a pretty cool Saturday
             night in Dauphin,” Fowler said                                                      Lyburn, as well the team’s alter- curlers that there is today. I’m
