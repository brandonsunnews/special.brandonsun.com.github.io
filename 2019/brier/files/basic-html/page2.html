                Brandon’s last Brier was a truly special event





             BY THOMAS FRIESEN
               If history can repeat itself, this Tim
             Hortons Brier will be one for the ages.
               With the success of local athletes hit-
             ting the pebbled ice in Brandon, the
             breakthrough for one of curling’s leg-
             ends and an idea that sparked a tradi-
             tion that encapsulates the beauty of the
             game like none other, the 1982 Brier,
             which was the last one hosted by Bran-
             don, was a monumental one.
               The 2017 Brier in St. John’s, N.L.,
             showcased a hometown team in Brad
             Gushue — this year’s Team Canada. The
             support for a local team is undeniably
             strong, and the 1982 Brier was off to a
             good start well before it started, when
             Mel Logan and his team out of the
             Souris Curling Club claimed the provin-
             cial title — a massive feat in itself.
               “Compared to Newfoundland, it’s a lot
             tougher,” Logan said.  “When Mark
             Noseworthy won, he played five games
             to get to the Brier. We played 18.”
               Logan had to win the Souris club title,
             then play a lengthy zone qualifier just to
             reach provincials.
               Along with Doug Armour, Lloyd Lang
             and Allan Granger, Logan reached his
             first provincial final and played Garry
             Ross, who was in his sixth-straight
             championship game. Ross was snake-
             bitten, and Logan was no match for him
             in that contest. Up 4-2 late in the game,
             Logan made a perfect hit-and-roll to
             count four and force a tough draw,
