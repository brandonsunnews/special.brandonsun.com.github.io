              Patch came out of necessity, became tradition





             Continued from Page 3

               “Any  time  we  played  in  West­
             ern  Canada,  we  knew  the  fans
             would  be  knowledgeable  and
             the  place  would  be  packed.  It
             was  a  great  place  to  play  in,”
             Hackner  said.  “(Lang)  gave  me
             some  pretty  good  advice  with
             the  media  and  how  to  respond
             to  questions.  That  really  helped
             me  going  in.  He  told  me  exactly
             what  to  expect.  It  could  be
             overwhelming   if   you   don’t
             know what’s going on.”
               Now  64,  Hackner  is  the
             Northern  Ontario  senior  men’s
             champion  again.  “I  keep  play­
             ing  because  I  still  throw  pretty
             good,  I  love  the  game,  I  love
             the  social  part  of  it  and  I’m
             going to keep doing it,” he said.
               The  social  part  makes  curl­
             ing  special.  Seldom  can  fans
             and   volunteers   interact   with
             the  stars  of  a  sport  at  its  biggest
             event,  let  alone  share  a  drink
             with  them.  That’s  exactly  what
             happens at the Brier Patch.
                                         The Patch started in Brandon at the 1982 Brier in an attempt to allow people who couldn't get tickets to the event an opportunity to watch the games on closed-circuit
