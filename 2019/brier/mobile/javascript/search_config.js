With the success of local athletes hit-              ting the pebbled ice in Brandon, the              breakthrough for one of curling’s leg-              ends and an idea that sparked a tradi-              tion that encapsulates the beauty of the              game like none other, the 1982 Brier,              which was the last one hosted by Bran-              don, was a monumental one.                The 2017 Brier in St. John’s, N.L.,              showcased a hometown team in Brad              Gushue — this year’s Team Canada. The              support for a local team is undeniably              strong, and the 1982 Brier was off to a              good start well before it started, when              Mel Logan and his team out of the              Souris Curling Club claimed the provin-              cial title — a massive feat in itself.                “Compared to Newfoundland, it’s a lot              tougher,” Logan said.  “When Mark              Noseworthy won, he played five games              to get to the Brier. We played 18.”                Logan had to win the Souris club title,              then play a lengthy zone qualifier just to              reach provincials.                Along with Doug Armour, Lloyd Lang              and Allan Granger, Logan reached his              first provincial final and played Garry              Ross, who was in his sixth-straight              championship game. Ross was snake-              bitten, and Logan was no match for him              in that contest. Up 4-2 late in the game,              Logan made a perfect hit-and-roll to              count four and force a tough draw,                                                 Manitoba skip Mel Logan watches as Doug Armour (from right), Lloyd Lang and Allan Granger sweep a rock during a game at the 1982 Brier in Brandon.

That’s  exactly  what              happens at the Brier Patch.

It has become a staple at the Brier ever since and been added to every Curling Canada event, including the Olympic Trials, pictured above in Ottawa in 2017.

Fowler earned his fourth trip to              the Brier in 2012, though it was              his first as a skip. He played              with Jeff Stoughton out of the              Charleswood Curling Club in              Winnipeg for the first three,              and needed all of that experi-              ence to get there on his own.
