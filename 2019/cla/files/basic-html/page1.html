        Ramsey tops this year’s awards








        BY PERRY BERGSON

          There are a lot of ways to deﬁne
        success for a coach.
          Tyson Ramsey, the new head coach
        and general manager of the Manitoba
        Junior Hockey League’s Virden Oil
        Capitals, is well aware that he’ll ulti-
        mately be judged by wins and losses.
        But that’s not the only part of the
        equation for the veteran coach.
          “I think at the end of the day, if
        you’ve contributed to a player’s well-
        being and helped them become bet-
        ter at the sport that they’re involved
        in and helped them become better
        people, you can’t look at that as any-
        thing but success,” Ramsey said. “Ob-                            2019
        viously with some of the elite level
        sports, winning and the standings
        and the records are something you
        look at as success, but that’s only one
        part of it. Even at the elite level sports,
        not everyone is going to make a living
        playing a sport and have a career in it.
          “I think at the end of the day, if the
        kids have enjoyed what they’ve done
        and they’ve learned something both
        on the ice or on the ball ﬁeld or on
        the court, and they learned a pile of
        things off it, you can’t look at that as
        anything but successful.”
          Ramsey knows what he’s talking
        about.
          After playing in the MJHL with the
        Winkler Flyers, Ramsey came home
        to play with the Brandon University
        Bobcats, serving as captain in his ﬁ-
        nal season in 2000-01.
          Ramsey started coaching peewee
        hockey in 2002 with Brad Wells when
        he was still playing at Brandon Uni-
        versity. A year later, he joined Ken
        Schneider with the AAA bantam
        squad, and then spent a season with
        the under-18 team in 2005-06.
          He took a few seasons off to play
        senior hockey, rejoining Schneider’s
        U18 staff as an assistant coach with
        the Wheat Kings in 2011-12. He spent
        three seasons in that role before tak-
        ing the helm in 2014-15.          Riverview School coach Tyson Ramsey is this year’s Community Leader of the Year. (Matt Goerzen/The Brandon Sun)
          In four years as head coach, he
        compiled a record of 120-55-1-4 and was awarded the head job in May.  at every level he has coached,” he in February practices began for the triguing to me was the growth that
