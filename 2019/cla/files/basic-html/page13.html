        Cowan ‘overwhelmed’ to get prestigious nod

















                        2019


        BY DIANE NELSON
          You could have knocked Lor-
        na Cowan over with a feather
        when she learned she’d been
        nominated for a Community
        Leader Award.
          “I’m a little overwhelmed,”
        Cowan said when informed
        she’d been given such a pres-
        tigious nod. “It is very much a
        surprise.”
           But like most nominees,
        Cowan was humble.
           “It’s lovely, but I don’t know
        if that would ﬁt me. But it’s very
        nice people think I am (a leader
        in the community).”
          While Cowan is modest, her
        track record speaks for itself.
        She turned 86 on Sept. 6, and
        has spent most of her life help-
        ing others, both as a career
        nurse and as a volunteer on
