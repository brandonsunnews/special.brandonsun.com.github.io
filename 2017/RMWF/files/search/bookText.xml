       We welcome everyone to the 110th edition

               Fair brings farm life to the city

       On behalf of the Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba and the organizing committee,
     we welcome patrons, exhibitors and sponsors to our 110th Royal Manitoba Winter
     Fair. We are proud to kick off a year of celebration across Canada: 2017 is Canada’s
     150th anniversary, and the 135th year for the Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba and
     the City of Brandon.
       The Royal Manitoba Winter Fair brings farm life to the city and connects you directly
     to food production and the agriculture industry, an important part of the Canadian
     economy. The City of Brandon and the Provincial Exhibition worked hard to bring
     the Keystone Centre to western Manitoba. It is an ideal facility to host the fair and
     showcase agriculture, culture, sport and business excellence.
       We are proud to honour Canadian history with the appearance of Lord Strathcona’s
     Horse Mounted Troop from the Canadian Armed Forces this year. Lord Strathcona           Wayne Buhr
     came to Canada as a fur trader, rose through the Hudson’s Bay Company, moved west
     to help establish Manitoba, and later became chair of the oldest bank in Canada.
       The equestrian events at the Winter Fair are world-class and we are honoured to
     have such high calibre of exhibitors join us every year. These athletes have worked
     hard to reach this level of competition and provide excellent entertainment for all
     ages.
       Thank you to our sponsors, exhibitors, volunteers and you, our patrons, for making
     this event possible. See you at the Fair, March 27 through April 1.

              Old-time fiddlers still a hit




       Since 1973, fiddlers of all ages have been
     performing at the Royal Manitoba Winter
       Fair.
       “880 CKLQ has been involved with the
     RMWF Fiddler’s Contest for many years,”
     said event host Leanne Doty, CKLQ
     music director. “This is such an important
     event that not only brings old-time music
     to a usually packed house, but also
     provides a stage for many budding and
     seasoned musicians to display their
     talents,” she said. “The very young fiddlers
     get to learn the spirit of competition while
     learning a trick or two from the more
     seasoned performers.”
       Many of today’s renowned fiddle
     players, like Allison Granger and Patti
     Kusturok, competed in the RMWF
     contests over the years and have gone on
     to prominent music careers and garnered
     many awards recognizing their talents.
       The fiddler’s contest takes place in the
     Amphitheatre on Wednesday, March 29
     at 7 p.m.

            Lord Strathcona’s Horse makes its debut


       A mounted troop will ride into the Royal
     Manitoba Winter Fair.
       New to this year’s stable of events, Lord
     Strathcona’s Horse (Royal Canadians) are
     in town to harken back to when the
     Canadian Forces regiment, now Edmonton-
     based, was wholly horse mounted.
       They will present the Strathcona
     Mounted Troop, 20 soldiers dressed in
     period uniform and mounted on horseback
     to perform cavalry demonstrations.
       Ron Kristjansson, general manager of the
     Provincial Exhibition of Manitoba, has seen
     the show before in Alberta.
       “It’s such a neat group, it’s a precision
     mounted group doing military maneuvers,”
     he said. “They’re going to be escorting our
     VIPs in.”
       The soldiers in the troop volunteer for at
     least one show per season.
       Their commitment is in addition to the
     soldier’s normal responsibilities as a
     member of the Canadian Forces.
       The Strathcona Mounted Troop will
     perform everyday at Westman Place Main
     Arena.

       Prize money: The performances in a
     show jumping competition are rewarded
     with money. The first 30 per cent of the
     placed riders receive prize money and the
     winner alone receives 30 per cent of the
     total prize money in a class.
       Stride: One of the main difficulties of
     show jumping lies in the way the riders
     manage the strides of their horses
     between fences. One cantering stride of
     a horse covers approximately 3.50 meters.
     The rider can shorten or lengthen their
     horse’s stride in order to adjust their
     number between two fences so that the
     horse can jump the obstacle in good
     condition, taking off neither too close nor
     too far.
       Table: Different scoring systems are
     used to place the competitors at the end
     of the class. The most common is “Table
     A,” where jumping faults or the first
     refusal generate four penalty points. Time
     faults may be added to the final result:
