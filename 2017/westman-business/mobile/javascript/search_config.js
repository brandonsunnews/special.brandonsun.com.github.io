That’s why making an informed decision on where you’re         going to live as you age gracefully is so important.           Moving from a single-family dwelling can be a positive         experience and for those who have made that decision,         many have discovered that their lifestyle improves tremen-         dously and your new residence quickly becomes your new         home.           Debbie Brown, general manager of Rotary Villas at Cro-         cus Gardens, said that it doesn’t take long for their new res-         idents to feel right at home in the safe, secure and         comfortable environment they provide, but what’s even         more rewarding is to see is how their lifestyle changes.           “We do everything we can to make Rotary Villas feel like         home, before long residents are socializing and taking part  While there are many benefits to living in a retirement  Drugs, Dr. Meredith’s Medical Clinic and Camelot Per-         in different activities.

Condominiums would over-         look the river valley and the area would be made         more affordable and business-friendly.           While longtime Brandon residents might get         tied up by their memories of what Brandon used         to be, Sneath said they should be considered just         that — memories.           “Obviously, it will never be again what it was,         but that doesn’t mean it can’t be something, maybe         even better,” she said.           Brandon’s downtown is a unique centre, in that         it will never attract the big box stores that appear         in other areas of the city, and it still carries a num-         ber of historic buildings.           There’s much that can be done to create a         bright future for the city’s downtown, with the         Sneath couple playing an ongoing role in the ef-         fort.           Even so, Sneath took a moment during her         presentation to remind the audience that although         she was invited to speak during the luncheon in         order to share her story and insights, she and         Jason have been far from alone in working toward         the same goal.           Although they’ve been getting attention as the         “new kids on the block,\" she said. \"There are         many, many downtown champions who have been         at this far longer than we have. We’re only one         small piece of the puzzle.”            » tclarke@brandonsun.com           » Twitter: @TylerClarkeMB              Since moving to Brandon three and a half years ago, Robyn — together with her husband and business partner Dr. Jason Sneath — has started Fraser Sneath                                                  Coffee, Bowerbird Holdings, Sneath Projects, and SKIN Clinics.

Then look no further than Victoria Landing Retirement Residence on the southeast         corner of First Street and Victoria Avenue.           Built on the site of the former St. Michael’s Academy, Victoria Landing boasts 136         suites on four floors and offers luxurious living in a safe environment. With staff on duty         24 hours a day, as well as a nurse, residents are sure to feel welcome, comfortable and se-         cure.           “People are able to continue to live independently in their suites and we offer the sup-         ports to allow them to do that,” said executive director Claudia Nohr. “Basically, people         can enjoy their day-to-day and let us do the work for them.”           Victoria Landing provides three meals a day, housekeeping, linen and towel service, and         maintenance. There’s an emergency pull-cord system in every suite, and extensive recre-         ational programming as well, with the added bonus of a secure building.           “Nobody gets a key, nobody gets a code – everything is controlled by our front desk         staff,” Nohr said. “So everybody buzzes to come in and everybody is asked to sign in, so         that way we always have accountability for everybody who’s in our building.”           There is a waiting list, but suites are always available, Nohr said, since people are not         necessarily ready to move when there’s a vacancy.           “A lot of people on our waiting list are basically making sure they have a plan for the         future should something happen,” Nohr said. “But meanwhile, they may not be ready to         make that lifestyle change just yet. So currently we do have some availability in our build-         ing.”           Victoria Landing offers one-bedroom suites ranging from 421 to 552 square feet. Dif-         ferent layouts are available, and most suites have balconies. Two-bedroom suites are also         available, but there aren’t as many of those as there are one-bedrooms, since according to         Nohr, most residents find one bedroom is sufficient.
