        Classic Trailers lets the product speak for itself




          Classic Trailers believes in the ‘no pres-
        sure’ approach when it comes to dealing
        with customers. 
          “We don’t have an on-site business man-
        ager,” said Jeff Pinnell of Classic. “We find
        it a little easier. It’s less pressure. You’re not
        being ‘put in the box’ – that kind of idea. We
        feel that people are more comfortable,
        which is very important to us. We let them
        take time to look around and find what fits
        their family’s needs.”
          It’s that type of salesmanship that has
        made Classic Trailers a leader in the RV in-
        dustry. After recent success in Headingly,
        the company has made its way to the
        Wheat City. They opened their doors offi-
        cially last July with an impressive 10,000
        square foot indoor showroom, which can fit
        up to ten trailers at one time. Year-round
        trailer shopping in Brandon has never been
        more comfortable.
          “It’s a fantastic place,” Pinnell said. “We
        have a good mix of different trailers in the
        showroom and it is always warm and com-
        fortable, no rain, no snow, no mosquitos –
        basically everything you want to avoid when
        camping!”</code></pre>
