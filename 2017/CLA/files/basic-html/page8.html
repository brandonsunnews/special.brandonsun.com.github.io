» VOLUNTEER AWARD

Wells credits rural
upbringing as
reason for award

  A rural upbringing, employer support, and a life-long desire       Jackie Wells (left), seen with the Brandon Regional Health Centre Foundation’s Cindy Buizer, won the Community Leader Award for

                                                                     volunteering with Westman Dream for Kids helped put

  Wells said her first taste of community support came when
she was young. Her father fell sick, so the community helped            When she gives her time to others, she feels she benefits from

that it’s important to give back to the community.”                  don’t take it for granted.”

  For 36 years Wells has been working at RBC Royal Bank. In          » The Brandon Sun
that time she’s had many roles at the bank, but is currently the
assistant to Terry Burgess, regional vice-president for Manitoba
West

  It was Burgess who nominated Wells for the Community
Leadership Award.

  “I started at the Royal Bank when I was 17,” Wells said. “It’s
a company that is very community minded.”

  One of RBC’s community programs is the Employee
Volunteer Grant. This grant provides RBC employees, who
spend 40 hours per year volunteering at a registered charity, the
opportunity to donate $500 to the charity of their choice. For
years, Wells has used the money to help local elementary
schools. RBC also offers its Day of Service Grant, in which
teams of six people or more can apply for a $1,000 grant for a
chosen charity, and RBC Team Action Grants for charity pledge
events such as.

  “We can have an impact in dollars, but we can also really
have an impact in hours,” Wells said.

  After losing her mother to cancer and her father to heart
failure, Wells found herself donating more time to the Canadian
Cancer Society and the Heart and Stroke Foundation. She also
managed to get 25 of her colleagues to join the Heart and Stroke
Foundation’s Big Bike. The group donated more than $5,000
to the cause.

  “A lot of it is my mind set,” Wells said. “But I’ve been so well
supported by my employer.”

  “I think, you can decide to take three hours to watch a TV
show, or you can take thee hours to make a difference.”

  Although many organizations and individuals struggle
financially, Wells said that donating your time can go just as far
as donating your money.

  “When my kids were young I worked part time,” she said.
“So there wasn’t a lot of extra cash around, but cash isn’t always
what people need. Sometimes people need the person, and a
bit of emotional and physical support.”

  Giving her time and support to others has always been a
passion for her, but that passion has grown further since the loss
