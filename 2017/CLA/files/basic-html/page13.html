until 2001.                                                            One such event was the 55-Plus Games, which were put on

  In 1995, Brandon Riverbank was established. Chrisp explained
that the organization works together with the City of Brandon
to create the best plan for developing the land around the
riverbank to attract tourists and community activity.

  Chrisp said that despite best intentions, it has been an uphill
battle trying to fulfil the plan.

  “We lost a number of our paths in the spring of 2011 in the
flood,” Chrisp said. “In 2014 we had another flood during the
summer when we had just gotten back on track after the 2011
flood. So we went backward again.”

  But the organization has persisted through the environmental
challenges and has responded with a 20-year-plan, which will
include an amphitheatre, more pathways, and a developed
garden area at the Riverbank Discovery Centre where wedding
ceremonies can be held.

  Chrisp’s community involvement, however, began in Virden,
when he started getting involved with the Kinsmen Club. He
moved up in the organization until he became president before
becoming Kinsmen’s governor for District 2. As governor he
worked with Kin Canada and its executives to increase club
membership.

  “I love working with people and other organizations,” Chrisp
said. “I enjoy seeing the improvement in the community and I
love giving back to the community.”

  Chrisp’s volunteerism was on display in 2012 when he was
awarded a Diamond Jubilee Medal.

  Presented to Chrisp by former Brandon-Souris MP Merv
Tweed, Chrisp said the award was an incredible and emotional
honour. He credits the honour to his fellow volunteers.

  “The award was presented to me but it was really presented
to everybody I’ve worked with over the years,” Chrisp said.
“That’s what makes success, when you’re working with great
volunteers.”

  Not long after his Diamond Jubilee Medal, Chrisp was
honoured again by the Brandon Wheat Kings with the Innovator
of the Month Award.

  “The recognition I got from the Wheat Kings was fantastic,
but it was really recognition, again, of all the people I’ve worked
with over the years.”

  In 2010, Chrisp was part of a committee that organized the
run of the Olympic torch through Brandon.

  “The committee, and I wasn’t part of the vote at all, but they
recommended that I be the person who actually lit the fire at
the Keystone Centre.” Chrisp said.
