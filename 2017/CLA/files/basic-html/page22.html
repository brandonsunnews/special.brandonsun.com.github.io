Expectations are a powerful tool for Ferguson

30, it’s safe to say he has been successful in living up to the motto.

  As a teacher and then a counsellor, Ferguson’s main goal was to
help students succeed.

  “I wanted to help people get back on track or just provide some
guidance for their future,” Ferguson said. “Unfortunately what ends
up happening is you’re also involved in kids who are leaving school,
and it always used to bother me that when a student was either
withdrawn (from school) or withdrew themselves … that there just
wasn’t anything within the division that we offered to stay in touch.”

  So Ferguson and a group of coworkers started doing research,
planned and proposed a solution to the division — and so Neelin
High School Off-Campus was born.

  “Or very first day we had zero students, and just through word
of mouth by the end of September we had about 79 to 80 students,”
Ferguson said.

  “We sort of started from scratch, and believe me, we started from
scratch … honestly we were flying by the seat of our pants. We’d
investigated different schools across Canada but when you’re starting
a program, it’s a lot of trial and error … But it was a lot of fun. I
think we envisioned this, but when we hit on it, we were like, man,
this is it.”

  Celebrating it’s tenth year, Neelin Off-Campus has helped
approximately 800 students graduate who otherwise wouldn’t have,
and Ferguson has been there every step of the way.

  “I get really excited about it, because these are the greatest kids.
In so many ways, they just didn’t fit inside the box — for some of
them it was personal, for others, sitting in a class just didn’t work
for them..but when they get to us … our approach is to work hard
to connect with them… Our unwritten motto is opening closed
doors,” said Ferguson. “It’s been really neat, it’s a blast…the last
10 years have not been a job, it’s been an experience. A really great
experience.”

  And each student has a special place in Ferguson’s heart — the
military kid from Shilo who dreamed of being a mountie but didn’t
have his Grade 12, the young man who left high school only needing
Grade 12 English to finish and came back with gusto to finish, the
young mothers who would come in with their babies just to get
their schooling done.

  “You have to have a heart for the kids, and we’ve got a lot of
people down there who love those kids,” Ferguson said. “For me,
the reward is being able to see the kids come into something that
they’ve never really had a lot of success in, and start to gain a vision
of what they want for their future … start to see that they can do
it, and make it through.”

  Even in retirement, Ferguson plans to continue helping and
supporting kids. He’s asked to stay on as a substitute at Neelin Off-
Campus and is eager to see what else the future might hold.

  “It’s been 10 years, and I’m leaving and this place still going. In
another 10 years, they might be like, ‘Who is Jim Ferguson?’ but it
doesn’t matter, because that school will still be there.”
