public address announcer has touched.

  She was floored earlier this month when she was asked
to attend the Relay for Life in Brandon and saw how many
luminaries were purchased as tributes to Michael, many
from former students of his at Brandon’s high schools.
One luminary stated how Michael was the only person to
have brought the city’s three high schools together.

  “It was really touching to see that,” Shannan said of the
numerous tributes. “I bought luminaries for my kids and
myself, but I wasn’t expecting to see such an outpouring.”

  Adamski was nominated for a courage and bravery
award for the inspiring way he fought terminal cancer.
Buoyed by a stubborn resolve, Adamski refused to believe
an inoperable and incurable cancer would determine his
fate.

  “He said he was going to be optimistic and he was going
to be the one in the million that was going to actually beat
this,” Shannan said in February. “I don’t think anyone
wants to face their own death, it’s hard to accept.”

  So instead, he would speak of the vacations he wanted
to go on, his teenaged children and of returning to work.

  Throughout his time at Brandon Regional Health
Centre, he heard from so many who cared. There were
lineups outside his hospital room. Hospital staff, including
many ex-students, fussed over him. Jillian DeCosse made
a video compilation of 23 testimonials from graduates
who shared their memories. The video merely “scratched
the surface” of the students positively impacted, she said
at the time.

  In his final weeks, visitors had to be turned away as
Michael was no longer himself.

  “It gave me something to tell him,” Shannan said. “I
kept telling him how loved he was by everyone; the outpour
was constant, the gifts and the cards never stopped.”

  His nomination for a courage and bravery award is one
of many ways the community’s love for him has been
made clear.

  “He did always want us to be proud of him, so I guess
this is one way of being proud of him,” Shannan said.
