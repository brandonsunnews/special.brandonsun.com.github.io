Cancer diagnosis led to advocacy for Orth

  It was 1996 when Meryl Orth, a teacher, was undergoing                                                                                        Meryl Orth’s role as an educator combined with a cancer diagno-

went on to discuss the topics of the forums with local politicians,
doctors, pharmacists, the elderly, and care home staff.

  This is just one of the instances in which Orth used her voice
to advocate for those without one. She has been nominated for
the Community Leader Award in the category of Seniors
Advocate.

  Meryl has several stories about her life experiences that led
to her advocating for the 55+ age group. But her role as an
educator is what influenced that desire the most.As a teacher
she spent her time advocating for children, who don’t necessarily
always have their voices and needs heard. Orth used the voice
she had, and represented the needs of her students by writing
to the government.

  There are many resources for children to be active in the
community, and to stay healthy, but they have parents who are
responsible for their wellbeing. Seniors, who don’t have an
obligated caregiver, need someone to make sure they’re aware
of their options on all fronts. Orth says, that’s where she comes
in. She had a special way of describing her transition into seniors
advocacy.

  “I took the advocacy and inclusivity that I applied to my work
for almost five decades, and I flip flopped it.” Orth said, referring
to how she applies the same principals in advocating for seniors,
as she did advocating for children in her career.

  Seniors for Seniors is an advocacy group in Brandon. Orth
said she started going there to improve her computer skills,
which they assisted her with. She quickly became a member
and a part of their advocacy team. Now, she’s the organization’s
chair.
