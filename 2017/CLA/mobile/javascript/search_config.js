We make sure that everything fits into education while listening to what the students think are important in their schooling and in their community … They feel like they have an ownership piece to it, and they really do.”    Having a good relationship with the students is just one of the benefits for McGuire-Holder and her students.    “I think the great thing is I’m able to get feedback from them on a personal level,” Mcguire-Holder said. “I am a teacher, and I am employed by (Brandon School Division), but for the kids I think they see me as an ally and an advocate, an enthusiastic supporter, while at the same time they know that I have a level of expectation for behaviour.”    Being in a position that allows her to build relationships and promote relationship building overall is one of Mcguire-Holder’s favourite parts of the job.    “Watching these kids grow … it’s very rewarding to see the kids connect … it doesn’t matter what school they’re from when they’re all getting along … it’s pretty incredible,” Mcguire-Holder said. “I want to make a difference. I think in all my teaching that this is probably one of the most impactful ways to get to kids — relationship building.”    Mcguire-Holder is also careful not to just talk the talk, but to walk the walk.    In addition to the work she does in the community with YR, McGuire-Holder also volunteers with the YMCA Brandon, the Canadian Red Cross, the Brandon Festival of the Arts, the Canadian Patient Engagement Network and Local Health Involvement Groups.    “I believe in giving back to the community and I’m grateful that I am able to give back … and that there are people who appreciate what we do,” McGuire-Holder said. “When I’ve done evacuations with the Red Cross, it always reminds me very clearly to be thankful for everything I have — my home, my family, my friends — when you work with some of the evacuees it’s a big reality wake-up … it reminds you how lucky we are, it keeps you honest and humble.”  » edebooy@brandonsun.com » Twitter: @erindebooy","","6 • COMMUNITY LEADER AWARDS                                                                                                                  THE BRANDON SUN • THURSDAY, JUNE 22, 2017  » ABOVE AND BEYOND AWARD                                                                                                                                               Jason Krieser is the sales                                                                                                                                              manager and interim general                                                                                                                                              manager of the Keystone                                                                                                                                              Centre.

The third aspect Cristall referenced was work environment. Since not all volunteer endeavours take place outside work time,         “One of the things he said in his speech was that Brandon has many volunteers rely on time off from work to fulfil their duties      always punched above its weight,” Cristall said. “That’s a perfect, as a community leader.                                                 perfect, line to describe what we do.”   Cristall recalled a significant story of a father-son duo who volunteered together at a week-long event.                               According to a Fraser Institute report released in December,   “They took the whole week off to come and help at the event,”        Manitoba ranked highest in charitable donations in the country. Cristall said. “They just loved what it is you do at these things.”   He said after the event, the men would have to return to their         “If you have community, you understand that you all have to jobs and catch up on a week’s worth of work.                           chip in,” Cristall said “And we have community.”   Cristall cited that as an example of exemplary volunteerism.   “Lastly: home. They pay a price,” Cristall said. “You’ve got         » The Brandon Sun chores and duties at home, and you don’t get them all done when you take significant volunteer roles.”   Approval and support from both home and work are important factors in being an effective volunteer.   Cristall said it’s pretty easy to get involved in activities in the community, noting that websites have listings for any major event looking for volunteers.   “Go find somewhere to volunteer that’s going to be short in duration,” Cristall said.

This grant provides RBC employees, who spend 40 hours per year volunteering at a registered charity, the opportunity to donate $500 to the charity of their choice.

After losing her mother to cancer and her father to heart failure, Wells found herself donating more time to the Canadian Cancer Society and the Heart and Stroke Foundation.

In his career, Chrisp worked as a public health inspector in                                                                            “I just want to say thank you to whoever nominated me for Virden and a regional supervisor with the ministry of the              “A lot of these events just wouldn’t be successful without the   this award.” environment in Dauphin, before moving to Brandon in 1991,            volunteer component.” Chrisp said. where he worked as the regional director of the Park West region                                                                        » The Brandon Sun until 2001.

Chrisp explained that the organization works together with the City of Brandon to create the best plan for developing the land around the riverbank to attract tourists and community activity.    Chrisp said that despite best intentions, it has been an uphill battle trying to fulfil the plan.    “We lost a number of our paths in the spring of 2011 in the flood,” Chrisp said. “In 2014 we had another flood during the summer when we had just gotten back on track after the 2011 flood. So we went backward again.”    But the organization has persisted through the environmental challenges and has responded with a 20-year-plan, which will include an amphitheatre, more pathways, and a developed garden area at the Riverbank Discovery Centre where wedding ceremonies can be held.    Chrisp’s community involvement, however, began in Virden, when he started getting involved with the Kinsmen Club. He moved up in the organization until he became president before becoming Kinsmen’s governor for District 2. As governor he worked with Kin Canada and its executives to increase club membership.    “I love working with people and other organizations,” Chrisp said. “I enjoy seeing the improvement in the community and I love giving back to the community.”    Chrisp’s volunteerism was on display in 2012 when he was awarded a Diamond Jubilee Medal.    Presented to Chrisp by former Brandon-Souris MP Merv Tweed, Chrisp said the award was an incredible and emotional honour. He credits the honour to his fellow volunteers.    “The award was presented to me but it was really presented to everybody I’ve worked with over the years,” Chrisp said. “That’s what makes success, when you’re working with great volunteers.”    Not long after his Diamond Jubilee Medal, Chrisp was honoured again by the Brandon Wheat Kings with the Innovator of the Month Award.    “The recognition I got from the Wheat Kings was fantastic, but it was really recognition, again, of all the people I’ve worked with over the years.”    In 2010, Chrisp was part of a committee that organized the run of the Olympic torch through Brandon.    “The committee, and I wasn’t part of the vote at all, but they recommended that I be the person who actually lit the fire at the Keystone Centre.” Chrisp said.

Community Leader Award for courage and bravery is more evidence of the impact he made in his life.    “As much as you’re hurting, it makes you proud of him,” his wife Shannan Adamski said. “I guess that’s all you have left in the end, the mark that you’ve left behind, and he seems to have really left an imprint with everybody; students, teachers and parents.”    The months following Michael’s passing from brain cancer on Mar. 11 have been difficult, Shannan admits, but the time has made indisputable the many lives the well- respected Brandon school principal and Wheat Kings public address announcer has touched.    She was floored earlier this month when she was asked to attend the Relay for Life in Brandon and saw how many luminaries were purchased as tributes to Michael, many from former students of his at Brandon’s high schools. One luminary stated how Michael was the only person to have brought the city’s three high schools together.    “It was really touching to see that,” Shannan said of the numerous tributes. “I bought luminaries for my kids and myself, but I wasn’t expecting to see such an outpouring.”    Adamski was nominated for a courage and bravery award for the inspiring way he fought terminal cancer. Buoyed by a stubborn resolve, Adamski refused to believe an inoperable and incurable cancer would determine his fate.    “He said he was going to be optimistic and he was going to be the one in the million that was going to actually beat this,” Shannan said in February. “I don’t think anyone wants to face their own death, it’s hard to accept.”    So instead, he would speak of the vacations he wanted to go on, his teenaged children and of returning to work.    Throughout his time at Brandon Regional Health Centre, he heard from so many who cared. There were lineups outside his hospital room. Hospital staff, including many ex-students, fussed over him. Jillian DeCosse made a video compilation of 23 testimonials from graduates who shared their memories.

This is just one of the instances in which Orth used her voice to advocate for those without one. She has been nominated for the Community Leader Award in the category of Seniors Advocate.    Meryl has several stories about her life experiences that led to her advocating for the 55+ age group. But her role as an educator is what influenced that desire the most.As a teacher she spent her time advocating for children, who don’t necessarily always have their voices and needs heard. Orth used the voice she had, and represented the needs of her students by writing to the government.    There are many resources for children to be active in the community, and to stay healthy, but they have parents who are responsible for their wellbeing. Seniors, who don’t have an obligated caregiver, need someone to make sure they’re aware of their options on all fronts. Orth says, that’s where she comes in. She had a special way of describing her transition into seniors advocacy.    “I took the advocacy and inclusivity that I applied to my work for almost five decades, and I flip flopped it.” Orth said, referring to how she applies the same principals in advocating for seniors, as she did advocating for children in her career.    Seniors for Seniors is an advocacy group in Brandon. Orth said she started going there to improve her computer skills, which they assisted her with. She quickly became a member and a part of their advocacy team. Now, she’s the organization’s chair.    “I contacted the Manitoba Association of Seniors Centres and became acquainted with what the province of Manitoba’s visions was, so I could bring it back to Seniors for Seniors.” Orth said.    She had list after list of specified resources for the elderly. Everything from assisted living and care home services, to transportation services, to orthopedic care, even over-the-phone entertainment for those with mobility issues.

(File) 30, it’s safe to say he has been successful in living up to the motto.    As a teacher and then a counsellor, Ferguson’s main goal was to help students succeed.    “I wanted to help people get back on track or just provide some guidance for their future,” Ferguson said. “Unfortunately what ends up happening is you’re also involved in kids who are leaving school, and it always used to bother me that when a student was either withdrawn (from school) or withdrew themselves … that there just wasn’t anything within the division that we offered to stay in touch.”    So Ferguson and a group of coworkers started doing research, planned and proposed a solution to the division — and so Neelin High School Off-Campus was born.    “Or very first day we had zero students, and just through word of mouth by the end of September we had about 79 to 80 students,” Ferguson said.    “We sort of started from scratch, and believe me, we started from scratch … honestly we were flying by the seat of our pants. We’d investigated different schools across Canada but when you’re starting a program, it’s a lot of trial and error … But it was a lot of fun. I think we envisioned this, but when we hit on it, we were like, man, this is it.”    Celebrating it’s tenth year, Neelin Off-Campus has helped approximately 800 students graduate who otherwise wouldn’t have, and Ferguson has been there every step of the way.    “I get really excited about it, because these are the greatest kids. In so many ways, they just didn’t fit inside the box — for some of them it was personal, for others, sitting in a class just didn’t work for them..but when they get to us … our approach is to work hard to connect with them… Our unwritten motto is opening closed doors,” said Ferguson. “It’s been really neat, it’s a blast…the last 10 years have not been a job, it’s been an experience. A really great experience.”    And each student has a special place in Ferguson’s heart — the military kid from Shilo who dreamed of being a mountie but didn’t have his Grade 12, the young man who left high school only needing Grade 12 English to finish and came back with gusto to finish, the young mothers who would come in with their babies just to get their schooling done.    “You have to have a heart for the kids, and we’ve got a lot of people down there who love those kids,” Ferguson said. “For me, the reward is being able to see the kids come into something that they’ve never really had a lot of success in, and start to gain a vision of what they want for their future … start to see that they can do it, and make it through.”    Even in retirement, Ferguson plans to continue helping and supporting kids. He’s asked to stay on as a substitute at Neelin Off- Campus and is eager to see what else the future might hold.    “It’s been 10 years, and I’m leaving and this place still going. In another 10 years, they might be like, ‘Who is Jim Ferguson?’ but it doesn’t matter, because that school will still be there.”  » edebooy@brandonsun.com » Twitter: @erindebooy","","24 • COMMUNITY LEADER AWARDS                                                                                                           THE BRANDON SUN • THURSDAY, JUNE 22, 2017  » COACH AWARD                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blaine Moroz, of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Westman Youth Football                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Association, uses sport to                                                                                                                                                                                                                      connect with kids who might                                                                                                                                                                                                                      otherwise fall through the                                                                                                                                                                                                                      cracks.
