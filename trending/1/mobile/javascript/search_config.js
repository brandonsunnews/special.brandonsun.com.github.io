Shaw laughs.                                   Where a ﬁrst-time tattoo recipient may be inclined to get nervous, she takes                                   it with an all-familiar stride.                                   “I’d rather him make sure it’s perfect,” Shaw said.                                   This isn’t Shaw’s ﬁrst tattoo rodeo. At 26 years old, she’s been getting inked                                   for almost 10 years now, and has plans for many, many more.                                   “As soon as I got my ﬁrst (tattoo), I booked my second one,” Shaw said laughing.                                   “I have a running list and it depends on how much money I have at the time …                                   I have a whole back piece planned, both my arms are going to be fully sleeved,                                   my other rib is deﬁnitely going to be done, and the outsides of both my legs —                                   then we’ll stop and take stock.”                                   Today Shaw is getting a watercolour style bird of paradise with script, based                                   on the poem Sonnet XVII by Pablo Neruda — a tribute to her boyfriend of ﬁve                                   years and Neruda, who Shaw states adamently is the best poet of the 20th                                   century.                                   “It has to do with loving someone in a way that isn’t for the whole world to see                                   ... the whole poem for me has been about what love actually is,” Shaw said. “It’s                                   beautfully written.”                                   Tattoos are a different way people can express themselves and tell a story,                                   Shaw said. She likes the idea of having a snapshot of her life on her body, even                                   if it stings a bit.                                   “It’s a cat scratch on a sunburn,” Shaw said. “It hurts, but when it’s a pain that                                   you’re expecting and once it starts happening … eventually your body just                                   starts to suck it up.”                                   “Women always take tattoos better than men,” Gammack adds, setting up a                                   row of bright ink colours on a side table.                                   The stencil of Shaw’s soon-to-be tattoo has now been perfectly placed, and                                   Gammack asks if she’s ready as the buzz of the tattoo machine reverberates                                   off the walls and ﬁlls the room.                                   “It’s surprisingly not that bad,” Shaw said as the ﬁrst line is drawn on her ribs,                                   arguably one of the most painful places to get tattooed.                                   Gammack said he always knew he wanted to do something creative, and                                   tattooing was at the top of his list.                                   But the transition from paper to skin wasn’t an easy one, he said.","Artistry_Tattoos_Layout 1  17-12-06  5:26 PM  Page 3                                 “A paper is stagnant, it doesn’t move. When you’re                    working on a living thing — something that breathes,                    something that reacts — it’s a huge learning curve,”                    Gammack said. “Just because you can draw, doesn’t                    mean you can tattoo.”                    With hard work and determination, Gammack has                    been tattooing now for nearlys three years.                    The challenge of the trade, and the ever-growing                    talent in the community, is the reason Gammack still                    loves what he does.                    “All these tattoo shows on television have upped                    everyone’s game and upped everyone’s creativity.                    Tattooing has become so popular that it allows people                    to be much more creative,” Gammack said. “I love the                    challenge of it. People come in with good ideas all the                    time … and basically you’re taking their ideas and                    making them your own. My goal is to try and make it                    better than they thought, better then they hoped for.                    You’re constantly improving and striving to be better.”                    With Brandon being as small as it is, tattooing has                    become somewhat of a competitive ﬁeld, Gammack                    said, which is a good thing.

The tattoo artists at Blood and Iron Tattoo tend to                    agree.                    “The amount of talent in the industry now is amazing,”                    said tattoo artist Lee Elvers. “You think you have a                    good day, and then you look at something someone                    else has done and you’re like, ‘well, I suck. Time to                    sharpen the pencil’ … You just have to keep trying to                    outdo yourself.”                    “Every time I turn around there’s someone doing                    something you’ve never seen before,” added tattoo                    artist Scott Oldenburger.                    Elvers and Oldenburger have both been in the tattoo                    business for approximately 16 years, with their fellow                    artist, TJ VanStone joining the team a little more than                    three years ago.                    A lot has changed in 16 years, Elvers said.                    “People who would have never gotten tattooed when                    we ﬁrst started are now coming in,” Oldenburger said.                    “We see a wide range of people.”                    “From kids to seniors; cops to criminals, basically,”                    Elvers added.                  20","Artistry_Tattoos_Layout 1  17-12-06  5:26 PM  Page 4                                                                                                TJ VanStone, a tattoo artist at Blood \& Iron Tattoo,                                                                                 works on an upper arm tattoo.

The lights are low, the music is blaring and for 45                    minutes, riders are guided through a challenging                    rhythm-based class.                    As a longtime runner, Ward was initially drawn to spin                    class for the vigorous workout. But it was the positive,                    motivating atmosphere that hooked her in.                       “It’s honestly so much bigger than                                 just a spin class.”                                                                       Dana and Whitney Roberts, owners of Tour Indoor Cycling.                    “From the second you walk in the door to the second                    you leave, you feel like you’re being pushed to be the  Brandon after several years in Calgary.

She                    recently took part in a challenge, where riders commit                    to a certain number of rides within 30 days.                    “That’s the biggest one, the accountability, and actually                    doing what you’re saying,” Ramaya said. “I’m trying to                    put my money where my mouth is.”                    For many riders, the group ﬁtness setting is preferred                    over a solo routine at a gym.                    “I’m not a gym kind of person, so the fact that this is not                    afﬁliated with a gym is even more enticing, and more                    of a reason to want to go,” Ramaya said.                    The spin class phenomenon is growing around the globe,                    with riders drawn to the music-thumping, cardio-party                    style. In Brandon there are varying spin class options                    available, such as at the YMCA, GoodLife Fitness and                    A\&L Get Active. Tour has its own unique style and it                    stands alone as the city’s only boutique spin studio.                    The classes seem to offer the ultimate trifecta: physical                    ﬁtness, mental clarity and a sense of community. With                    that combination, it’s no surprise that transformations                    are happening on a regular basis — whether it’s weight                    loss, ﬁtness goals or just a more positive outlook.                    “They’re dropping inches around their body, and they’ll                    tell you they’re feeling so much better,” said Shane                    Robins, avid rider and tour guide. “Their energy level is                    through the roof… It is so motivating.”                    All ﬁtness levels are encouraged to take part in any                    class, as the rider is in control. While the classes are                    intense, riders add as much or as little resistance as                    they need and “ride to the beat.”                    “The classes will always be challenging because you’ll                    ﬁnd that you’ll increase your resistance as you get                    stronger,” Robins said.                    The ﬁrst class is free at Tour, and any passes purchased                    don’t expire for two years. The studio also offers                    private rides for staff parties and team building.

Each student, it was a clear, took their own spin at            TOP MARTINI/RUNNER‐UP                    what a festive drink means to them.                    “You guys look like you had fun doing it, and you             Very Merry Lemon Meringue Martini,                    probably had a lot of fun practicing,” Dave Perkins,                    acting dean of the program, told the students. “I                    thought you had a lot of creativityAnd as the panelists                    told the gathered students, there wasn’t a drink in the                    bunch they would have sent back.                    It’s proof enough you’d want any of these students at                    your holiday parties behind the bar.                    Such a role at her family functions would suit                    Numrich, she admits.                    “Which I’m totally ﬁne with, because I can pour a little                    bit extra in the glass for me.”                     JUDGES:                    Diane Nelson, wine columnist at The Brandon Sun,                                            Mali Pomito,                    former college professor                                                                 by Samantha Cooke  TOP COCKTAIL                     Danielle Adriaansen, public affairs director at                    Assiniboine Community College                     Dave Perkins, acting dean - business, agriculture and                    environment at Assiniboine Community College                     GRAND WINNER: TOP MARTINI                    Christmas Snow, by Simone Reis                     When a judge doesn’t want to put your drink down,                    it’s a good sign.                    That was Diane Nelson’s predicament, after sipping                    this sweet drink by Simone Reis with three and a half                    ounces of alcohol.                    “I’m not even really sure why. But for me, it worked,                    and I’m not into sweet stuff,” she said. “I can’t believe                    the amount of alcohol that’s in there, but it was so                    beautifully balanced with that condensed milk, I think     by Dani Gemme  TOP HOT DRINK                    it evened it out so much.”                                    Terry’s Hot Chocolate,                    A summertime vibe can be discerned in this beverage,                    featuring servings of Malibu Coconut Rum Liqueur                    and coconut milk.                    It’s a variation on an all-season drink Brazilians would                    enjoy in Reis’ native country, where she lived up until                    last year wh      en she moved to Brandon with her family                    to pursue a career in the hospitality industry.                    In order to give her version a more festive feel, she                    chose to make a coconut variation, rather than use                    Cachaça rum normally found in the drink.                    It may not be as holiday-themed as other drinks                    offered, but it is no doubt a treat, for its sweetness                    and strong alcoholic content.               34                                                                        Visit brandonsun.com/trending                                                                                       for all the recipes of the winners.","3700297_SobeysExtra_Layout 1  17-12-06  5:45 PM  Page 1                                                                                                                                                                      Product selection may vary                   ake the pressure off holiday menu planning.
