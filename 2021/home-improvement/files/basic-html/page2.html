        Some good


        reasons to

        renovate


        your home

        in the fall




          Although most home renova-
        tion projects can be undertaken
        at any time of the year, there are
        numerous advantages to start-
        ing them in the fall. Unless you
        need to deal with urgent repairs,
        here are five reasons it’s best to
        renovate in autumn.
         •  Ideal temperatures — Un-
            like the weather that’s typi-
            cal in winter and summer,
            the coolness of fall offers
            optimal working conditions
            for most renovation proj-
            ects.
         •  Prompt service — Since the
            demand for home mainte-
            nance work tends to dimin-
            ish at the end of summer,
            contractors and tradespeo-
            ple are more readily avail-
            able in the fall. This means
            shorter wait times for ser-
            vice.
         •  Lower costs — Given the
            decrease in demand at this
            time of the year, some home
            renovation companies re-
            duce their prices in the fall,
            which could allow you to
            enjoy considerable savings.
         •  Simpler logistics — The in-
            flux of workers, temporary
