Unless you         need to deal with urgent repairs,         here are five reasons it’s best to         renovate in autumn.          •  Ideal temperatures — Un-             like the weather that’s typi-             cal in winter and summer,             the coolness of fall offers             optimal working conditions             for most renovation proj-             ects.          •  Prompt service — Since the             demand for home mainte-             nance work tends to dimin-             ish at the end of summer,             contractors and tradespeo-             ple are more readily avail-             able in the fall. This means             shorter wait times for ser-             vice.          •  Lower costs — Given the             decrease in demand at this             time of the year, some home             renovation companies re-             duce their prices in the fall,             which could allow you to             enjoy considerable savings.          •  Simpler logistics — The in-             flux of workers, temporary             loss of living space and the   DT Roofing president and owner Drayson Tousignant showcases his company’s workplace Tuesday.
