(File/Winni-         peg Free Press)         Helping you adapt and succeed in a post-pandemic world               At  University  of  Manitoba         Extended Education, continu-         ing  education  is  what  we  do.         In the late 1940s, we were here         to  help  people  move  forward         in  their  lives  and  in  their  ca-         reers  after  the  Second  World         War, and today we are here to         help you adapt and succeed in         a post-pandemic world.           Extended Education contin-         ues to do what we always have         done, provide short credentials         in partnerships and in consul-         tation with industry. But soon         we will also do so with micro-         credentials  and  other  short         programs  designed  to  meet         immediate industry needs and         digitally  document  skills  and         competencies learned.           New programs           In  Winter  2022,  Extended         Education  will  launch  two         new programs. The ﬁrst is the          Building  Information  Model-          ing (BIM) certiﬁcate program         for  those  in  architecture,  en-         gineering,  construction  and         other  related  disciplines  to         gain  important  knowledge         about this intelligent 3D mod-         eling  process.  The  second  is          the  Artiﬁcial  Intelligence  (AI)          micro-certiﬁcate  program  to         learn to leverage AI in order to         devise and implement techni-         cal solutions for your business         or organization.           In the future, in addition to         our  variety  of  programs  and         courses,  there  will  also  be         micro-credentials   complete         with what makes them unique         --  the  digital  documenting         of  skills  and  competencies         learned.

After all, with gyms, dance studios         and  other  recreation  facilities  be-         ing  shut  down  due  to  public  health         restrictions,  many  individuals  were         left at home for long stretches of time         without  a  support  system  to  keep         them motivated.           Thankfully,  in-person  group  ﬁt-          ness has been back on the upswing         throughout the summer, with drop-         ping  COVID  cases  allowing  certain         clubs  to  reunite  and  pick  up  where         they left off.           These loosened COVID restrictions         have  been  a  breath  of  fresh  air  for         people like Lisa Vasconcelos, artistic         director  of  the  local  theatre  group         Mecca Productions.           Throughout Aug. 9-12, Vasconcelos         and  her  team  organized  their  usual         summer camp activities, where chil-         dren aged 12 to 16 got the opportu-         nity to learn choral and dance skills         in groups.           This  all  culminated  with  a  ﬁnal          performance  at  Rideau  Park,  which         marked the ﬁrst time Mecca had put          on  a  public  performance  after  their         recent  stage  production  of “Spama-         lot” was cut short just as COVID cases         began to emerge.           “We  did  a  couple  of  in-class  pro-         ductions, but yesterday was the ﬁrst          time  we  performed  since  Manitoba         closed down in March of 2020,” Vas-         concelos said on Aug. 13. “So it was         awesome! There were parents there,         and they really loved it too.”    Children between the ages of 12 and 16 from throughout Westman perform a dance number for family members at the end of Mecca Productions four           Monique  Roy-Keller  told  the  Sun   half-day summer camp at Rideau Park on Aug. 12.

We are also offering a         brand new program this fall         for children ages 6-8 called         “Big Kid Beats”. Each class         will offer a variety of mu-         sical activities, including         drumming, singing, move-         ment-to-music and musical         games. Class activities will         be tailored to provide oppor-         tunities to build social-emo-         tional skills, improve self-         expression and to establish         basic music skills. All instru-         ments used will be provided,         and no musical experience is         necessary.           Cost of registration for all         programs is $80.

However, with         choices ranging from soccer, dance         and martial arts to acting, draw-         ing and music lessons, you might         be uncertain what to pick. Here         are three factors to consider before         you make a decision.           • Your children’s preferences           You can certainly suggest ac-         tivities that play to your children’s         natural abilities or teach them new         skills, but if you want to ensure         your children will be motivated         and have fun, the decision should         largely be left up to them. Do your         best to respect their wishes, even         if the activity isn’t one you would         have chosen or strays from your         children’s usual interests.           • Your budget           Some activities are more expen-         sive than others, especially if the   LEFT: A boy plays the grand piano at home.
