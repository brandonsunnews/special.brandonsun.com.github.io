        Three factors to consider when choosing after-school activities



           If you want to register your chil-
        dren for after-school activities,
        there’s no shortage of fun and ed-
        ucational options. However, with
        choices ranging from soccer, dance
        and martial arts to acting, draw-
        ing and music lessons, you might
        be uncertain what to pick. Here
        are three factors to consider before
        you make a decision.
          • Your children’s preferences
          You can certainly suggest ac-
        tivities that play to your children’s
        natural abilities or teach them new
        skills, but if you want to ensure
        your children will be motivated
        and have fun, the decision should
        largely be left up to them. Do your
        best to respect their wishes, even
        if the activity isn’t one you would
        have chosen or strays from your
        children’s usual interests.
          • Your budget
          Some activities are more expen-
        sive than others, especially if the   LEFT: A boy plays the grand piano at home. RIGHT: Little boy playing ice hockey at arena. A hockey player in uni-
