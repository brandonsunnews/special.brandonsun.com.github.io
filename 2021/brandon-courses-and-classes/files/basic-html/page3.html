        Brandon getting back in the groove







        BY KYLE DARBYSON
          Throughout  the  COVID-19  pan-
        demic,  many  Brandonites  have  fall-
        en into more of a sedentary lifestyle
        through no real fault of their own.
          After all, with gyms, dance studios
        and  other  recreation  facilities  be-
        ing  shut  down  due  to  public  health
        restrictions,  many  individuals  were
        left at home for long stretches of time
        without  a  support  system  to  keep
        them motivated.
          Thankfully,  in-person  group  ﬁt-

        ness has been back on the upswing
        throughout the summer, with drop-
        ping  COVID  cases  allowing  certain
        clubs  to  reunite  and  pick  up  where
        they left off.
          These loosened COVID restrictions
        have  been  a  breath  of  fresh  air  for
        people like Lisa Vasconcelos, artistic
        director  of  the  local  theatre  group
        Mecca Productions.
          Throughout Aug. 9-12, Vasconcelos
        and  her  team  organized  their  usual
        summer camp activities, where chil-
        dren aged 12 to 16 got the opportu-
        nity to learn choral and dance skills
        in groups.
          This  all  culminated  with  a  ﬁnal

        performance  at  Rideau  Park,  which
        marked the ﬁrst time Mecca had put

        on  a  public  performance  after  their
        recent  stage  production  of “Spama-
        lot” was cut short just as COVID cases
        began to emerge.
          “We  did  a  couple  of  in-class  pro-
        ductions, but yesterday was the ﬁrst

        time  we  performed  since  Manitoba
        closed down in March of 2020,” Vas-
        concelos said on Aug. 13. “So it was
        awesome! There were parents there,
        and they really loved it too.”    Children between the ages of 12 and 16 from throughout Westman perform a dance number for family members at the end of Mecca Productions four
          Monique  Roy-Keller  told  the  Sun   half-day summer camp at Rideau Park on Aug. 12. The camp taught choral and dance skills and culminated in a ﬁnal performance in the park. (Tim Smith/
