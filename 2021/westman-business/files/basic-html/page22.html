           A tradition of serving generations





           of Brandonites: Chancellor Dental






           BY MIRANDA LEYBOURNE

            It  takes a lot  of experience, wisdom
           and foresight to strike the right bal-
           ance between tradition and innovation.
           The dentists, dental assistants, hygien-
           ists  and  administrative  professionals at
           Chancellor Dental, located at 343 18 St.
           in Brandon, have done just that — even
           amidst the changes and challenges of a
           global pandemic.
            Husband-and-wife team of dental pro-
           fessionals, Dr. Cameron Norrie and Dr.
           Darci Bonar, relocated from Winnipeg to
           Brandon in May, but they’ve had ties to
           Chancellor Dental long before that. Dar-
           ci, who is currently on maternity leave
           after having the couples’ second child,
           is the daughter of Dr. James Bonar, while
           Cameron has been working in the prac-
           tice for quite a while, coming in  from
           Winnipeg to practice surgery and seda-
           tion at Chancellor Dental for the past five
           years.
            The couple became co-owners of
