     REALTOR





     CHRIS LOW



     RE/MAX VALLEYVIEW








     Q: Tell us about your professional background and experience.

     A: Born and raised in  Western Manitoba, I grew up  in the small  farming community of
        Foxwarren. After playing six seasons of professional hockey in the United States I settled
        down in Brandon  and started a family with my wife Tanis. We have two amazing children;
        Tiana and Brady. I spent 15 years with Chemtrade (formerly Canexus) as a power engineer
        before becoming a Licensed  Real Estate Professional. I worked with J&G Homes during my
        first year, selling new builds and condos. For the past five years, I have been with RE/MAX
        Valleyview Realty.

     Q: What inspired you to get into your chosen profession?
     A: I always had an interest in sales, and enjoy cultivating meaningful relationships with people
        both personally and professionally.  Real estate, as a profession, let’s me do that and has also
        allowed me to get back in touch with agricultural roots as well.


     Q: What is your specialty? What makes you unique?
     A: Social media marketing has become a critical means of advertising potential properties. It’s
        no secret that buyers are using online and the digital world as their main resource during
        their house hunting journey. I recognize the importance of utilizing these platforms to
        ensure your property not only reaches maximum exposure, but that it is advertised and                           Residential, Farms & Acerages
        marketed in a way to ensure its value is represented to its fullest.


     Q: Why/when should customers use your service?
     A: Whether you’re buying or selling a property, using a professional Licensed Real Estate
        Salesperson is in your best interest. I will make myself available 24/7 to answer your questions,                  VALLEYVIEW REALTY
        and you can count on my attention to detail, negotiation skills and market knowledge to
        make your experience as smooth and positive as possible. I can help point you in the direction
        of reputable tradespeople for work on your home or inspections, mortgage brokers/lenders                          204-573-5699
        or any other  professional services you may require.

     Q: What about your company makes or had made you proud?                                                              chrislow@remax.net
