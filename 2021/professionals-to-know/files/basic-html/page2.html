     BARRISTER AND SOLICITOR





     JODI WYMAN B.A. LL.B



     PATERSONS LLP








     Q: Tell us about your professional background and experience.
     A: I’m a partner of Patersons LLP and I’ve been practicing law in Brandon since 1998. I work
        primarily in family law. I have a certificate in mediation and have done training in collaborative
        family law, advanced mediation and arbitration.

     Q: What inspired you to get into your chosen profession?

     A: I wanted to find a profession that would let me be self-employed and involved helping
        people through difficult times. I also wanted a profession that had a wide variety of options,
        in case I didn’t like the first thing I tried. I was sure I wouldn’t like appearing in court, but in
        fact that’s one of the parts of the job that is the most challenging, in a good way.

     Q: What is your specialty? What makes you unique?

     A: I’ve been practicing family law for 23 years and have appeared in all levels of court. However,
        my work in family law litigation made me realize that court is usually not the best place for
        couples, or for families. That’s why I began mediation training in 2012, and then went on to
        complete advanced mediation and arbitration training. Helping separated couples resolve
        their issues privately, creatively and a little more peacefully is very rewarding work.

     Q: Why/when should customers use your service?

     A: Separated couples often think their only option is to hire lawyers and go to court when they
        can’t sort out agreements about their kids and their assets themselves. However, hiring a
        private mediator or arbitrator lets them control the process. It can be, and is usually, much
        faster and less expensive. It lets them keep their personal and financial business private, and
        most importantly shelters their children from their conflict. They can come up with creative                      1040 Princess Ave Unit 1, Brandon
        solutions that aren’t possible in court. And with respect to children, of course it’s best that
        parents make the decisions about their own kids.
                                                                                                                          204-727-2424
     Q: What about your company makes or has made you the most proud?

     A: Our firm has expanded quite a lot in the last few years, and we’re able to offer clients the full
        array of legal services. We all take professional development seriously and make sure we’re                       jwyman@patersons.ca
        up to date and using best practices. We never lose sight of the fact that our business only
        exists because of our amazing clients, and we try our best to make sure they get the service                      www.patersons.ca
        they deserve.







     ORTHODONTIST





     DR. ROB MINTENKO



     WINBURN ORTHODONTICS









     Q: Tell us about your professional background and experience.
     A:  As an orthodontist I have had many years of post-secondary education to become an expert in my
        field. I started off by completing several years of undergraduate sciences at the University of Regina,
        then completed dental school at the University of Saskatchewan. I then practiced as a general
        dentist for several years before being accepted into a 3 year orthodontic residency at the University
        of British Columbia in Vancouver where I obtained my diploma in Orthodontics and Master of
        Science in Craniofacial Science. I returned to practice as an orthodontic specialist in Regina and
        then recently became the new owner and orthodontist of Winburn Orthodontics in Brandon in
        2020.

     Q: What inspired you to get into your chosen profession?

     A:  I grew up babysitting the children of an orthodontist in Regina and looked up to him as a mentor.
        He only had the best things to say about his profession as an orthodontist and it really had an
        impact on me at a young age.

     Q: What is your specialty? What makes you unique?
     A:  My specialty is in the field of orthodontics – straightening teeth, correcting bites and improving
        facial balance. As a general dentist you are able to complete any dental procedure, including
        orthodontics, however becoming an orthodontic specialist means you have completed three years
        of full time studies in just the field of orthodontics and that you limit your practice to orthodontics
        – when it comes to straightening teeth and fixing bites, you want to see an orthodontic specialist.

     Q: Do you have an upcoming event or milestone you want people to know about?
     A:  One major upcoming event is the official rebranding of our orthodontic clinic later this fall from
        Winburn Orthodontics to Mint Orthodontics. I took over in 2020 from the well renowned Dr. Jay                         1711 Kirkcaldy Dr Suite C6,
        Winburn, who had practiced as an orthodontist in Brandon for 43 years, and now that some time                         Brandon
        has passed I am wanting to update the clinic name and branding to reflect the direction of the clinic
        moving into the future.
                                                                                                                              204-727-0401
     Q: What about your company makes or has made you the most proud?
     A:  There is nothing that makes me prouder than seeing the pure joy and happiness of someone seeing                      info@drwinburn.com
        their new smile for the first time after removing their braces. The process and length of orthodontic
        treatment can be quite extended, so to have such a delayed gratification of seeing one’s new smile
        and bite after the braces are removed is truly unmatched. I feel thankful every day to work in such
        a profession that allows such a dramatic transformation for people to go through.                                     winburnorthodontics.com</code></pre>
