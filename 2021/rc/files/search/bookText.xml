        Annual awards net record number of votes






        By TyleR claRke
          This  year’s  Westman  Readers’
        Choice set a new record, netting a to-
        tal of 198,168 votes.
          “I’m not surprised,” Brandon Sun
        publisher Jim Mihaly said, adding the
        newspaper’s annual effort has sharp-
        ly grown in prominence during every
        one of its five years.
          From the inaugural 2017 event’s
        8,788 votes to last year’s 94,937, West-
        man has been taking notice.
          The  awards’ 100  categories have
        been switched up a great deal over
        the course of its five years to narrow
        in on what readers are most interest-
        ed in, Mihaly said, adding voters plug
        in their own answers rather than rely
        on pre-determined options, which
        keeps the effort firmly in the com-
        munity’s hands.
          Among the most popular competi-
        tions in each year’s event is the “Best
        Pizza Shop” category, for which Pizza
        Express has retained gold four years
        running.
          That was until now, with Fast Fired
        by Carbone bumping the longtime
        Brandon institution to second place.
          Fast Fired opened at Brandon’s
        Corral Centre in 2018 and is format-
        ted as a “build your own” pizza shop,
        where customers select toppings and
        watching staff build their pizza in
        front of them.
          Upon learning they placed in the
        top three alongside Pizza Express
        and Marino’s Pizza, owner Jayson

                    Our Carpets and Flooring are First Quality. Always.
                               Our Prices are First Rate. Always.

                           Our Performance is First Class. Always.


            WHAT IS VALUE?
            By itself, Price means nothing. By itself Performance means little, there is always someone
            who will promise more. Even Quality, by itself, is suspect. But Price, Performance, and
            Quality together mean value… and Value is everything!
