        City police officer an avid community steward





        BY DIANE NELSON

          There’s no question it’s an honour when someone you know
        – or someone you don’t – nominates you for a Community
        Leader Award. Many have described it as overwhelming,
        humbling and just plain nice.
          But when your boss who goes to the trouble of creating and
        submitting a detailed letter nominating you because of what he
        or she feels are outstanding qualifications, that’s really a thrill.
          “So he’s the guy!” Brandon Police Services Deputy Chief
        Randy Lewis said when he found out his nominator was Police
        Chief Wayne Balcaen. “Wow! But this is not really my
        personality. I certainly don’t need to be acknowledged on a
        public level in any way, shape or form. But it’s certainly pleasing
        that he thinks highly of what I do.”
          According to Balcaen, Lewis joined the Brandon Police
        Service in 1994 and has held numerous leadership positions
        within the organization.
          Lewis has led members of the Police Service on Patrol, in the
        Crime Section, Patrol Support Unit, was the department's
        firearms instructor, and was a leader of the Tactical Response
        Unit for many years.
          All of those positions demanded that he shoulder enormous
        responsibility, while also accepting the potential risk and
        challenges of those jobs. Balcaen said that Lewis recognized
        that being in law enforcement can take an emotional, physical
        and spiritual toll on officers and other staff members, which is
        why he was a proponent of the Brandon Police Service Wellness
        Team. The team includes a cross-section of civilian and police                                                                              Brandon Police Service deputy
