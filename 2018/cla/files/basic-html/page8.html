        Wark-Brown helps by taking photos of furry friends




        BY MELISSA VERGE
          Mandy Wark-Brown’s clients don’t speak to
        her- at least not in English, and they won’t smile
        on command as she snaps their pictures.  She
        describes taking photos of them like
        photographing little toddlers hyped up on sugar.
          Still, it’s work she loves — she’s been
        volunteering her time since 2012 to take
        professional photos of dogs for Funds For Furry
        Friends (FFFF). That’s one of the reasons Wark-
        Brown was nominated for a community leader
        award; for the extensive work she does volunteering with FFFF.
          It started back in 2011 when she adopted her dog from them.
          “I noticed when I was searching through all the rescues that all the
        pictures weren’t visually appealing,” she said.
          That discovery prompted her to speak to the director of Funds For
        Furry Friends who also happened to be her dogs foster mom.
          “I told them that they could probably adopt out more dogs if their
        pictures were better, and I offered to do it for them,” she said. She’s been
        their photographer ever since, giving time and her skills as a professional
        photographer to help dogs get adopted more quickly.
          “I feel it’s our responsibility to look after animals, to make sure that
        they have the proper homes, they’re cared for and things like that,” she
        said.
          One certain senior citizen she’s helped over the seven years she’s been
        volunteering her time with the organization sticks out for Wark-Brown.
          Hugo was an older gentleman, a black lab mix with a grey snout who
        had been in the rescue for quite awhile. He was having problems getting
        adopted for a couple of reasons.
          “Black dogs are always the hardest to go because they say you can’t see
        their expressions on their faces, and just the old wives tale surrounding
        black animals,” Wark-Brown said.
          One day she snapped a candid photo of Hugo with the then president
        of the rescue, with a big smile on his face as the president gave him a
        hug. That photo ended up in the Westman Journal or the Brandon Sun.
          “An elderly couple spotted it [the photo] and they adopted him right
        away,” she said.
          It’s moments like these that drive Wark-Brown to continue to spend as
        much time as she does volunteering her time to help in the community.
          “It’s good, it keeps me pushing to do more,” she said. “I’m always
        messaging Jill, [the director of FFFF) ‘I have the itches coming, lets do a
        shoot,’” she said.
          The work is perfect for Wark-Brown, who said she doesn’t have the
        emotional strength to do some of the day to day stuff the rescue deals
        with, such as finding animals on the side of the highway. “I kind of just
        stick with the fundraising and the pictures and stuff like that,” she said.
          Besides FFFF, Wark-Brown also does volunteer work with KidSport,
        which provides financial assistance to athletes who would otherwise be
        unable to participate in organized sport. She’s been volunteering with
        them since 2013.
          “Probably the best part is that it gives kids an opportunity to stay out
        of trouble, and that keeps us going with what we’re doing,” Wark-Brown
        said.
          Her own kids are in soccer, so she gets to see the benefits of participating
        in sport first hand.
          For the 40-year-old whether it’s the work she does with KidSport or
        with FFFF, volunteering is something she enjoys doing. She does it to
        make a difference in the community.
          “I’m not a rich person, I don’t own my own house, but I feel like no
        matter what your position is in life you always have time to either donate
        money or donate your time,” she said.
