        What to look for in a leader









        BY MATT GOERZEN
          You don’t have to look very
        hard for the leaders in your
        community. They are the men
        and women who take on the
        burdens     of    ensuring
        celebrations and events go
        forward, who put on those
        skates and coach a kids’
        hockey team, or pick up that
        piece of garbage lying in a
        public park.
          They are the folks who bake
        pies for the community bake
        sale fundraiser, put in time
        setting up a stage for a local
        festival, organize a community
        fish fry, and do the heavy
        lifting for an elderly neighbour
        who needs their sidewalk
        shoveled.
          They take initiative. They
        give back. And they take the
        lead on a community project,
        help foster team spirit and
        energize their volunteers. They
        are the ones who make our
        communities worth living
        within —  our often unsung
        heroes.
          Last night, in our second
        Community Leader Awards
        event, we celebrated Westman
        individuals who have made a
        difference, either through their
        leadership, or their humble
        actions.
          In this special awards
        section, we have recounted the
        efforts of 23 individuals who
        fit the description of a
        community leader. As part of
        the process, our selection
        committee ranked each leader
        in their respective category —  Mayor Rick Chrest speaks during the Community Leader Awards presentation at the Victoria Inn on Wednesday evening.
