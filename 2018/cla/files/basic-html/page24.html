        BY JILLIAN AUSTIN

          Growing up on the east coast of Canada, Ian Grant recalled
        how the importance of “giving back” was instilled in him from
        a young age.
          “My folks always told me to give back to the community that
        you lived in — they did in many different ways,” Grant said.
          Perhaps it was that message that inspired him to pursue a
        career in law enforcement. He began his policing career with
        the RCMP in 1980, and served in Brandon, Wasagaming and
        Flin Flon detachments. In April 1985, he became a member of
        the Brandon Police Service. Grant served as Brandon’s chief of
        police from 2013 until his retirement in 2017 .
          Throughout his career, Grant was involved in many areas of
        the police department, from the tactical response unit to the
        crime division, and said he enjoyed them all.                                                                                               Brandon Police Service chief Ian

        Fuelled by empathy and compassion, Longstreet tackles the meth crisis



        BY ERIN DEBOOY
          Kim Longstreet has walked the walk, and now she’s talking
        the talk.
          Always up to fight for the underdog, Longstreet has used her
        personal experience, empathy and passion to advocate for a
        better community.
          “I’m very touched that somebody feels that I’m worthy to put
        my name forward (for a Community Leader Award),”
        Longstreet said.
          “You do what you do because you know it’s the right thing
        to do. I don’t do what I do for people to tell me that I’m doing
        a great job or give me awards, I do it because if you don’t, who
        else is going to?”
          A member of the Brandon Bear Clan since the group’s
        inception last June, Longstreet said she has never missed a patrol.
          The group has embarked on 105 patrols so far, walking
        countless kilometres and dedicating numerous hours to making                                                                                Kim Longstreet has become an
