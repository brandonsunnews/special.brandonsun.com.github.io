        “Disruptor” dedicated to seniors’ advocacy




        BY MICHAEL LEE

          Gail Freeman-Campbell has been called a “disruptor” for
        the work she does with her private home-care business
        Daughter On Call, but it’s a title she takes as a positive more
        than anything.
          “If you don’t raise the issues they never get dealt with and I
        really like a challenge,” she said.
          Freeman-Campbell is the owner and CEO of Daughter On
        Call and the visionary behind the private senior’s residence on
        Eighth Street, Kirbyson Home, which opened last November.
          Named after one of its tenants, Fay Kirbyson, and her son
        who became a major investor in the project, Kirbyson Home
        provides 24-hour care, independence and gives residents a place
        that resembles a home, with private bedrooms and bathrooms
        and a large living-room space.
          Last December, the Brandon Neighbourhood Renewal
        Corporation honoured Freeman-Campbell with a housing
        award for her Kirbyson Home residence.
          Despite the negativity she first received about Kirbyson
        Home — including criticisms that nobody would pay more to
        live in it — Freeman-Campbell said she has built up a long
        wait list and has plans to build a second residence at the corner
        of 26th Street and McTavish Avenue this summer. The building
        is expected to be completed either in late fall or early winter.
          “Every week, I have builders and investors calling and
        wanting to build and put one up for me somewhere, whether
        it’s in Brandon or rural Manitoba,” she said.
          Freeman-Campbell, a former nurse at the Brandon Reginal
        Health Centre and LPN instructor at Assiniboine Community
        College, started Daughter On Call nearly six years ago as a  Owner and CEO of Daughter On Call Gail Freeman-Campbell. (Michael Lee/The Brandon Sun)
        way to give people better care and comfort when it comes to
        health care.
          She said her career at the hospital wasn’t going in the
        direction she wanted it to go and she just didn’t have the same
        satisfaction with her job compared to when she first graduated
        from school.
          With Daughter On Call, Freeman-Campbell said she aimed
        to establish a sense of trust with her clients and build
        relationships with both them and their families.
          This move away from the “cookie-cutter approach” of
        government creates a level of service for each individual,
        Freeman-Campbell said. For example, where one person may
        require a half-hour to take a bath, another client with
        Alzheimer’s may need an hour or more.
          “So I think the public appreciates that fact, that we will do
        what they are looking for specifically,” she said.
          And as baby boomers age, Freeman-Campbell expects there
        will be more people who will want that choice between a
        personal care home or something else.
          Starting out with one health-care aide, Daughter On Call
        now employs 70 staff and has an office in Neepawa, with
        another set to open in Portage la Prairie this fall.
          The inspiration for Kirbyson Home, meanwhile, came after
        she said she saw a need for 24-hour care, in light of the long
        wait times for personal care home placements.
          And although she can’t offer the same wages as the
        government can, Freeman-Campbell said it is offset by the
        work-life balance she is able to offer her employees, whether
        it’s a single mom who has to take her child to a lesson or sports
        practice, or an employee who is going to school.
          In the end, she said she will not ask her staff to do anything
        she won’t do herself.                                                                                                                       Brandon Sun Daughter on Call

        Nichols helps keep Erickson seniors active




        BY MICHAEL LEE

          Inspired by her love for people and community, Mary Nichols
        is lauded in Erickson as someone who puts the needs of others
        well ahead of her own.
          Nichols is the resource coordinator for the community group
        Services To Seniors, an organization that provides programs
        and support to seniors living in the Erickson, Onanole and the
        Sandy Lake areas.
          Since taking up the job 11 years ago, Nichols has helped
        organize coffee parties, exercise classes and arranged for seniors
        to get walkers and wheelchairs when they need them.
          “I care about the people who live in this community,” she
        said. “The main bottom line for my job is helping to keep people
        in their homes as long as possible.”
          Originally from Winnipeg, Nichols moved to Erickson with
        her husband. She said her son was already living in the area,
        while her husband fell in love with the countryside.
          “I thought I was coming here to die,” Nichols said, as she
        wondered what she would do in the country.
          It was at that point she decided to apply for a job as the
        resource coordinator for Services To Seniors after the previous
        coordinator passed away.
          Nichols admits she didn’t know too much about the position
        when she applied, but what she did know going into it was that
        the job required a caring person to fill that role.
          “The job description asked for that kind of direction (and) I
        believe I felt I had the leadership skills to do that,” she said.
          And even though the position is only part time, Nichols is
        said to have put in more hours than her job description entails.
          She has been known for calling people during snow storms,
        arranging rides to doctors appointments and filling out
        government forms for clients.
          If she knows of anyone who lives in a relatively isolated area,
        Nichols will take the time to go out and drive them to local
        events. “”It’s all about communication,” she said.
          Nichols was instrumental in moving Services To Seniors out
        of its storage-room space in the municipal office building to its
        current location down the street.
          Along with being an active member of her local Lutheran
        chuch, she has also coordinated a volunteer palliative care
        program and installs the Victoria Lifeline medical alert system
        directly into peoples’ homes herself.
          Services To Seniors has also been involved with other
        community initiatives over the years. In 2015, Services To  Senior's advocate Mary Nichols from Erickson. (Matt Goerzen/The Brandon Sun)
        Seniors and the Riding Mountain Biosphere Reserve acquired

        garden in Erickson.                                     “I’ve asked the funeral director to clean my desk when they put  myself wanting to quit this job and doing much else,” she said.
          The idea was to help seniors access good, quality produce  me in the box, that’s what’s next,” she said with a laugh.  “Other than that, I would be doing community service again.”
