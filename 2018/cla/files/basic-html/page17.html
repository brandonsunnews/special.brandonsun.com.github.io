        Teacher enlists another generation of environmental stewards



        BY TYLER CLARKE

          Instilling her love of environmental stewardship in the students
        she teaches, Coleen McKellar has proven herself a leader in the
        the field.
          Growing up, the Crocus Plains
        Secondary School teacher said that she
        was always interested in the sciences,
        but that there was something about
        becoming a researcher that didn’t quite
        resonate with her.
          With education the closes thing she
        could do to remain in the sciences, she
        became a teacher.
          It’s a decision that she has remained
        satisfied with, and which she proudly
        notes has resulted in others taking up the environmental causes
        she’s passionate about.
          “I have managed to pass, I think, some of the knowledge
        along, and hopefully it’ll make a bit of a difference,” she said.
        “I just want people to be aware that little things make a
        difference, and every little bit helps.”
          In addition to teaching environmentally-themed classes to
        Crocus Plains students, McKellar also brought Water Festival
        to Brandon, which since 2010 has taught environmental
        stewardship and water conservation to grades 1 to 4 students
        from throughout Brandon.
          Crocus Plains students walk the younger students through a
        number of stations, which teach them the implications of things
        like brushing their teeth with the water off while doing so, and
        taking shorter showers.
          McKellar said that the students tend to take these messages
        home with their parents and become teachers themselves.
          On the teaching front, she said that Crocus Plains students
        also learn how to instruct others in environmental stewardship,
        which allows the passion to spread even wider.
          “The big kids are so good with the little kids,” she said. “A
        big smile always comes on their face when they see them.”
          McKellar also helps organize the annual Envirothon at the
        Riverbank Discovery Centre, which has high school students
        from across the region compete in various areas of
        environmental stewardship.                              Crocus Plains Regional Secondary School Science teacher Coleen McKellar is pictured in her classroom. (Tyler Clarke/The Brandon Sun)
