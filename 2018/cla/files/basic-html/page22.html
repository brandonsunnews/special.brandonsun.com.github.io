        Rotarian spending her retirement doing ‘rewarding’ volunteer work



        BY MELISSA VERGE

          Dayle Hughson was in her car delivering flowers for Mother’s
        Day — one of the many projects this Sunset Rotary Club
        member is a part of —  when she got the call that she’d been
        nominated for a Community Leader Award.
          “It’s a great honour, I think that its nice to have volunteerism
        recognized,” she said, adding that just getting the phone call
        was exciting.
          Delivering flowers for Mother’s
        Day is one of the many projects that
        Hughson has volunteered to help out
        with in the community.
          She’s lived in Brandon for 15 years,
        and she estimates that she spends
        about 20 hours on average per week
        participating in various volunteer
        positions.
          She’s the director of the provincial exhibition as well as co-
        chair of the summer fair. She’s also a member of the Sunset
        Rotary Club, which does a lot of volunteer work around the
        community, including the highly popular new event, Ribfest,
        and providing guest services at the summer and winter fairs.
        She’s also involved with Child and Family Services of Westman,
        and she works with the Interprovincial Association for Native
        Employment.
          It’s a lot of commitments, but Hughson said working full-
        time before she retired was good practice for the amount of
        time she spends volunteering. For 32 years she worked for a
        private company that was involved with employing individuals
        with handicaps and disabilities, something that she has continued
        to stay involved with through volunteer work.
          “I’m kind of used to scheduling things and being able to do
        two or three things at once, women can multitask,” Hughson
        said.
          At 71-years-old she’s been retired since 2012, and volunteering
        is a very important part of her life now.
          “It keeps you from getting bored and old it keeps me young
        because I’m working with the young people,” Hughson said.
          She recalls one memorable moment she had as a volunteer  Dayle Hughson is involved with many different things in the Brandon community, including the Sunset Rotary Club. Here, Hughson

        club donates books to the program, and inmates who have
        children take the books and read them onto a recorded CD.  It helps that her commitments are spaced out a little bit, and  she said that other people, who maybe have yet to give it a try,
