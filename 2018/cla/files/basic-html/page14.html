        » TEACHER AWARD, SPONSORED BY ASSINIBOINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

        ‘Genuinely an inspiration,’ educator goes above and beyond



        BY DIANE NELSON
          Teachers.
          They’re among the most important people we encounter in
        the course of our lives.
          Bad ones can leave a person confused, discouraged and
        unfulfilled.
          But good ones can encourage their students to embrace new
        ways of thinking, help them develop self-reliance and confidence,
        and open them up to a world of possibilities.
          According to nominator Amber Bollman, Assiniboine
        Community College’s Amanda McGregor, who teaches
        primarily Human Resources in ACC’s School of Business, is
        an educator that goes above and beyond what’s expected of her
        — and then some.
          “Amanda has dedicated herself to her students,” Bollman
        said.
          “She always puts her students’ needs first. She tries to make
        learning exciting as well as practical. Amanda works hard to
        ensure her students have the skills they need to enter the
        workforce. She has gone as far as setting up assignments in
        conjunction with industry leaders. This has given us exposure
        to the Human Resources world. We have been given a small
        snapshot of what our careers may look like.
          “Amanda does not shy away from any task she is handed.
        She is continually upgrading her education. Her experience in
        Human Resources is vast but she is always looking for new
        professional development opportunities to better herself and
        the quality of education she provides to her students. She gives
        career, educational and emotional support and advice. She is
        always willing to go the extra mile for anyone who crosses her
        path. She is genuinely an inspiration and the world is a better
        place because of her. I am blessed to have crossed paths with
        such an amazing woman.”
          McGregor was teary when informed of the high praise
        Bollman had heaped upon her, and said while she’s grateful
        and humbled that her student thinks so highly of her, being
        nominated for a Community Leader Award is somewhat
        daunting.
          “I feel a bit overwhelmed by this whole thing,” she said. “What
        I do isn’t unusual or extraordinary. But it is so nice, especially
        coming from Amber, who has very high standards for herself,
        and for her to think that of me means a lot.”
          While she works hard to stay up-to-date with the HR industry
        and bring fresh perspectives to the classroom, McGregor said
        she really loves learning new things and sharing those discoveries
        with her pupils.
          “I have a real enthusiasm for it,” she said. “What I try to be
        is a helper as much as I can. I’ve had tons of people in my life
        who have helped me see potential in myself when I didn’t see
        it, so I just try to do the same.”
          McGregor also said she found out early on that education
        can be the key to success.
          “If you get an education it opens doors — it’s the best gift
        you can give yourself,” she said. “So to be a small part of seeing
        people better their lives, and the lives of their families, is really
        gratifying.
          “And if I can get them excited about learning and education,
        that’s wonderful to me. The highlight of my career is that I get
        to be part of something that is really important to people.”  Assiniboine Community College business administration instructor Amanda McGregor. (Matt Goerzen/The Brandon Sun)
          While she’s eager to help her students along the way, she
        refuses to take credit for their accomplishments.       of this (Community Leader) recognition because I think what  “But I work with a bunch of teachers who do an even better

        Chorale founder shares her love for music with students

          The list of Liz Grant’s accomplishments could likely
        fill an entire newspaper.
          And the number of lives she’s impacted through her
        music teaching and choir directing might possibly
        round out two editions.
          Which is why she was nominated anonymously,
        but with a number of enthusiastic references, for the
