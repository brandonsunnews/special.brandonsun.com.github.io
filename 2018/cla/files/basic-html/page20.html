        Mother’s devotion perseveres following the tragic loss of her husband



        BY DIANE NELSON

          For journalists, a passion for meeting, talking with and
        discovering more about people is a mandatory part of the job.
        And while everyone is fascinating for one reason or another,
        and everybody has a story — or many stories — to tell, over
        the course of a career, there are certain folks who just stand out.
          That was certainly the case for former Brandon Sun reporter
        Ian Froese.
          When he talked with Caryn Waldon and wrote her story for
        Sun readers, he was tremendously moved by her strength in the
        face of terrible tragedy. So touched was he, in fact, that he
        nominated the young woman for the Community Leader Award
        in the Courage/Bravery category.
          Waldon was pregnant with her and her husband Bryce’s first
        child when Bryce died suddenly while building their dream
        home in December of last year. Sophia Bryce Waldon was born
        on Feb. 9, and rather than wallowing in the depths of her grief,
        Caryn Waldon is instead focused on the miracle that is her
        daughter.
          “I’m so blessed to have Soph,” she said.
          “And I got that from Bryce. She makes it easier for me to be
        happy because she makes me happy.
        And she has his smile. That was one
        of the things I loved most about him,
        was his smile. So every day when I
        walk through that door and get Soph
        from her crib and she smiles at me, I
        know today’s going to be a good day.”
          That’s not to say that Waldon doesn’t
        have down times, when she sheds tears
        over her loss, the fact that Sophia will
        never meet her father and that Bryce didn’t have the chance to
        be a parent. But she credits a legion of supporters for helping
        her through the roughest of times.                      Caryn Waldon holds her daughter Sophia Bryce Waldon in Sophia's nursery at her home in Brandon's south end. Caryn's husband Bryce
