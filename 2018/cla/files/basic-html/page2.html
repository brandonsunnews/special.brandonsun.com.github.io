        Luhowy an ‘unsung hero of her community’






















        BY MATT GOERZEN
          Tireless. Selfless. Dedicated.
          These are, perhaps, the most apt descriptions of
        Shoal Lake resident and longtime Westman-area
        volunteer Cory Luhowy.
          Dubbed by those who nominated her as an
        “unsung hero of her community,” Luhowy has
        played a part in nearly every event and been a
        member of nearly every committee that can be
        found in Shoal Lake for the past eight years. And
        her time spent as a community volunteer is much
        longer if you count her previous 18 years living in
        nearby Minnedosa.
          And she does it all with a positive attitude — a
        self-styled “git ‘er done” work ethic — and lists,
        oh so many lists.
          “Lists are fantastic,” Luhowy said with a laugh.
        “They keep you organized and you make sure you
        are where you’re supposed to be on a certain day
        and have a certain thing done by a certain time.”
          The list of organizations and causes Luhowy has
        given her time to over the past decades is daunting.
        She has helped organize fall and spring suppers,
        done catechism teaching and church cleaning.
          From her time on various committees and
        boards, she has worn many hats, from bookkeeper,
        hockey and baseball team manager, to trustee,
        canteen manager, fish fry organizer, and even
        ensuring Canada Day celebrations got off the
        ground.
          She is the current treasurer of the Shoal Lake
        Chamber of Commerce and the Shoal Lake
        Agricultural Society, and the secretary of the Shoal
        Lake Curling club. Luhowy volunteers time in the
        Shoal Lake Communiplex kitchen, is part of the
        St. Helen’s Parish Council, and does makeup and
        ticket sales for the Strathclair Drama Club.
          She credits her father for her volunteer spirit —
        he was her role model for how to care about and
        give time to her community.
          “He was a saint,” she said. “He took the bull by
        the horns and got things done. You have to make
        a plan and you stick to it.”
          If there is something to be done, the community
        is pretty much guaranteed Luhowy will be involved.
        She knows how to get a group organized to take
        on a task, lays out her expectations and lets people
        do their jobs under her guidance.
          “She’s just on so many committees,” said Sheri
        Baydak, a volunteer with the Shoal Lake
        Agricultural Society and one of the people who
        put Luhowy’s name forward for the award.
          “It’s not too often you get someone on just about
        everything in the community. And she gets nothing
        to do it. She works her little butt off. She’s basically
        one of the first to step up. If it wasn’t for her
        knowledge and commitment and help — she’s
        really got the brains for all the financial part of it.”
          With all of these volunteer commitments,
        Luhowy still manages to work full time with the
        Strathclair Credit Union branch in Shoal Lake. In
        fact, she says being employed close to home gives
        her the ability to take on many volunteer roles in
        the community, and get so much done.
          “I’m very fortunate to be able to work at home
        (in Shoal Lake) and I think that’s what makes my
        accessibility so easy too, that people can just stop
        in,” Luhowy said. “‘I hear you’re collecting for this
        or do you need my name for this.’ Yup, very
        accessible.”
          But even a long-serving volunteer like Luhowy,
        who admits her volunteer efforts seem to fall into
        an annual pattern, can find new challenges. Last
        October, Luhowy took on a new role as a member
        of the Shoal Lake Community Foundation, a
        charity organization that provides financial support
        to local initiatives.
          Established in 2013, the Shoal Lake Community
        Foundation’s mission is described on its website as
        to “continuously support and enhance the lives of
        the residents of Shoal Lake and Oakburn through
        grants that inspire community leadership.”
          The Shoal Lake Community Foundation is part
        of a wider network of community foundations that
        originated with the creation of The Winnipeg
        Foundation in 1921.
          As per the Endow Manitoba website, every gift
        made to an endowment fund at a community
        foundation is pooled and permanently invested.
        The interest earned on these funds is then
        distributed as grants to support a variety of local
        charitable projects. The capital is never spent,
        ensuring a lasting source of support for a
        community.
          While she’s still learning the ropes on the
        foundation — “I’m still pretty green,” she said —
        Luhowy says she has found this new challenge
        interesting, and she seems excited to be part of
        something big and lasting.
          “It’s like leaving a legacy for your community to
        raise funds to turn back into the community,”
        Luhowy said. “It’s something very new for me,  Shoal Lake resident Cory Luhowy has been named this year’s Community Leader of the Year. (Submitted)
        and something I’ve never been a part of before.
        And I have a lot to learn.”
          Nevertheless, her community obviously values
        all the time and effort she has put back into the
        region. Like Baydak said, volunteers are the  “
        lifeblood of any small community, and Luhowy is
        a testament to that fact.                       “It’s not too often you get someone on just about everything in the community. And she gets nothing to do it.
          “If we didn’t have our volunteers who are willing  She works her little butt off. She’s basically one of the first to step up.
        to help, we wouldn’t have anything,” Baydak said.
