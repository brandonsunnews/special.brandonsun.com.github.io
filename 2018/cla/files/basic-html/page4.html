        Caldwell an “inspirational leader in the coaching world”



        BY DIANE NELSON
        groundwork was built as a“
          From teaching school to
        coaching hockey, Bob Caldwell
        is “an inspirational leader in
        the coaching world and the

        back-to-back Great Plains
        Athletic        Conference          — Bob Caldwell
        championships in 1973-74 and
        1974-75.
          And Caldwell has parlayed
        his acumen and expertise in more than 40 years of coaching at
        the local, national and international levels.
          Hockey Canada honoured Caldwell with the Gordon Jukes
        Award in 2015, recognizing his contributions to amateur hockey
        at the national level.
          As well, he was one of the driving forces behind the formation
        of the National Coach Mentorship Program and was skills
        coach for Hockey Canada’s U17 national team.
          According to Tweed, Caldwell’s coaching credentials include
        global assignments. He coached Poland’s under-18 team and
        mentored coaches in Romania. The International Ice Hockey
        Federation also brought Caldwell in as a skills camp leader for
        youth, and he was part of the IIHF’s coach development
        exchange program.
          Closer to home, he served as an assistant coach with Andy
        Murray in 2012 with the NCAA Division 1 Western Michigan
        Broncos.
          In 2004, Caldwell spearheaded, and is still involved in, the
        Breakfast Club in Deloraine, an early-morning program that
        gives young players a chance to work on their hockey skills. The
        concept is now used across the country.
          He was named Hockey Manitoba’s Volunteer of the Year in
        2012 and inducted as a member of the Deloraine Royals into
        the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in 2015.
          “On a personal note,” Tweed wrote, “Bob has served as
        teacher, coach, father, and parent to all of my children, and I
        know he has played a significant role in their life successes.”
          Despite all his accomplishments, or maybe because of them,
        Caldwell has no intention of throwing in the towel anytime
        soon.  “I guess when you get old, there’s stuff in your rearview
        mirror – I work with Hockey Canada ad Hockey Manitoba
        doing stuff so hopefully I’ll keep doing it for as long as I can,”  Community Leader Award “Coach” category recipient Bob Caldwell is pictured on the rink. (Submitted)

        Tosh credited with coaching youths in life, as well as in sports



        BY DIANE NELSON

          Formerly of Glenboro, Glen Tosh has been
        a resident of Souris for the past decade, and
        wasted no time getting involved in the
        activities of his new community once he
        arrived.  But prior to that, about 12 years ago,
        Tosh was named Sport Manitoba’s Volunteer
        of the Year. That honour is presented to a
        sport volunteer in the Westman Region for
        his or her significant contributions to the enhancement and
        development of amateur sport. And those who selected Tosh
        deemed him “the epitome of the community volunteer,” lauding
        his resume as “both long and impressive.”
          He coached senior hockey and led his club to the 2004
        Provincial B Championship – Glenboro’s first in thirty years.
        In 2005, he coached the Glenboro high school hockey team,
        was behind the bench for the minor bantam development hockey
        club, served as a director for Hockey Manitoba, was president
        of the Tiger Hills Hockey League and served as a player/coach
        with the Cypress River Comets Intermediate Baseball team.
          Over the years, Tosh coached bantam baseball, high school
        baseball, badminton, the high school girls’ volleyball program
        (they won a provincial title in 1996), and was involved in the
        community’s junior golf program.
          As if that wasn’t enough, Tosh has served as president of the
        Glenboro Golf and Country Club, chairman of the Glenboro
        Community Development Corporation and was a board
        member of the Glenboro and Area Community Foundation.
          Then came the move to Souris, where his list of
        accomplishments and accolades continued to grow. According
        to nominator Mark Ryckman, Tosh has coached his own
        daughter Brynn’s all-girls Souris Minor Hockey for the past
        seven years.
          He also manages her extended-season team and coached the  Community Leader Award “Coach” category ﬁnalist Glen Tosh. (Submitted)
