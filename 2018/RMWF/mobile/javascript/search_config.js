It happens to be the name of her solo album.        “It kind of envelopes who I am as a person, as a musician, it’s      something that will always be close to me,” said the fiddler, who      grew up in Nesbitt, of her CD.        “I’m very lucky that I was put in lessons at a young age so that      I’m able to do what I do now.”        Granger is returning to Brandon in late March, as has become      tradition, to judge at the Royal Fiddlers’ Contest at the Winter Fair.      She currently resides in Edmonton as a professional musician and      teacher.        The contest marked her first fiddling competition at the age of      eight. She won fourth-place in the open round.

She took after-school classical training at Bran-      don University and helped guide the Fantasy Fid-      dlers group of teenaged players who travelled      neighbouring provinces and states to play.        Out-of-town fiddlers linked Granger with Bar-      rage, a violin-based modern ensemble, whom she      travelled the world with beginning at the age of 16.      Performing 350 shows a year wasn’t uncommon, she      said.        Throughout her career, she’s played for Prince      Charles, the Saudi royal family and done tours with      Canadian troops overseas. She’s performed along-      side country artists Gord Bamford, Brett Kissel and      Aaron Pritchett.        Granger was nominated for five Canadian Coun-      try Music Awards and won as top fiddler in 2013      for her work touring with Bamford.         Allison Granger received the ﬁddler of the year award at the 2013 Canadian Country Music Association      » Continued on Page 30                     awards.

STRIDE        One of the main difficulties of show jump-      ing lies in the way the riders will manage the      strides of their horses between the fences. One      cantering stride of a horse covers approxi-      mately 3.50 metres. The rider can shorten or      lengthen the strides in order to adjust their      number between two fences so that the horse      can jump the obstacle in good conditions, tak-  points.
